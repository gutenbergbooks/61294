</div>
<p>Once upon a time there was a very poor
boy, who had no cap on his head, no shoes on
his feet, and never a penny in his pocket. He
was so poor that he did not even have a name.
His father had gone to sea many years ago in
a ship called The Big Dipper, and as he had
never returned, people said surely he must be
dead. So the boy had gone to live in a small,
dark house beside the sea, with his great-aunt,
who was very old and cross and strict. She
did not let him have any sugar on his cereal
or butter on his bread, and every day after
school she spanked him soundly for all the mistakes
he had made that day, and if he had not
made any she spanked him just the same for
all those he would probably make to-morrow,
or the next day, or the next. When he asked
for a bit of soap to blow bright soap-bubbles,
she cried:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp006.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="398" height="429" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Soap-bubbles, indeed! Soap is made only
to wash one&rsquo;s face with. You may have all
you want for that, but for bubbles, no, no!
Bless my boots, what will you ask for next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the other children played on the
beach, building castles in the sand, or picking
up pretty shells, this poor boy had to gather
driftwood for his great-aunt&rsquo;s kitchen fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>But for all his hard luck he was always
whistling blithely at his work. He would whistle
all the tunes in the hymn book, and all the
sailor&rsquo;s songs, and the nursery songs, and then
some more that he made up as he ran along the
beach picking up driftwood. Of course his
great-aunt had forbidden his whistling about
the house, but other people liked to hear him,
and since he had no name, they called him
&ldquo;Birdling.&rdquo; His great-aunt called him &ldquo;You!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day, after he had come home from
school, washed his hands, eaten his dry bread
and drunk his tea without sugar or cream, he
went as usual to the beach to gather wood; but
this day, all the boys from school were down
by the sea-side making sail-boats. Their mothers
and aunts and grandmas had given them
odd bits of muslin from the rag-bag for sails,
and their fathers and uncles and grandpas had
given them little pots of paint, and the old boat-builder
who lived on the beach had supplied
the nails and boards and no end of good advice.
They were building a splendid fleet, and when
Birdling came whistling along the sands, they
all hailed him and shouted:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;Birdling, Birdling, come and build a boat!
We have nails to spare, and surely you have
some nice boards in your load of driftwood!
Come, come and build a boat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Birdling, forgetting all about his duties
and his great-aunt, sat down in the warm yellow
sand, and built a boat of driftwood; and while
he worked he whistled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>The boys were all so glad to hear him and
be able to play with him that they gave him
all the paint and nails that they could spare, as
well as string for his rigging and a lead sinker
for his anchor. Of course he had many kinds
of paint, and not enough of any one color to
paint his whole boat, so her hull was black, the
trimming golden-yellow, the deck bright-blue
and the mast was green. She was a funny
boat indeed, but Birdling liked her none the less
and wanted to name her after his father&rsquo;s ship,
the Big Dipper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she isn&rsquo;t big!&rdquo; said the other boys.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the smallest boat of all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he called her the Little Dipper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do for a sail?&rdquo; the others
asked. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d love to give you some muslin,
but we haven&rsquo;t a bit to spare.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp009.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="578" height="423" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Here was a dilemma indeed. Then Birdling
remembered that he had a patch on the seat of
his trousers that he did not need at all, for his
great-aunt always patched them before they
went into holes (&ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she would say,
&ldquo;why bless my boots, he&rsquo;d sit them through in
two minutes!&rdquo;); and now he did a dreadful thing,
he took off the patch and used it for a sail!</p>
<p>They had such a good time with the boats,
loading them with cargoes of sea-shells and digging
harbors and chasing away the crabs who
came to watch, that they did not notice how the
sun had dipped down behind the sand-dunes
and the light-house brightened far out at sea.
Suddenly they heard the curfew ring.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp010.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="795" height="346" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s past supper-time!&rdquo; they cried,
and all the boys snatched up their boats and ran
home. In a moment the beach was as deserted
as the sea, and Birdling sat alone on the sands,
his boat between his knees, while the shadows
of night crept down to the water. At the
furthest end of the beach gleamed a dull square
of light&mdash;that was his great-aunt&rsquo;s window,
brightened by the oil-lamp behind it:</p>
<p>Oh, how she was going to scold him now!
For this time he had really been naughty. He
had gathered no driftwood, he was late to supper,
and he had ripped the patch off the seat
of his trousers!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dare take you home, Little Dipper,&rdquo;
he said as he placed his boat in the safest harbor,
as far as possible from the incoming tide. &ldquo;My
great-aunt would burn you in the kitchen stove.
Goodby, Little Dipper!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp011.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="447" height="261" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>His great-aunt met him at the door as he
came home. She was so angry that her cap
had slid over one ear, her eyes were like tiny
hot coals and her very apron-strings curled with
wrath. She boxed Birdling&rsquo;s ears, smack,
smack, smack!&mdash;until they were as pink as seashells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, you, you,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;You shall
have no supper, sir, but a very good whipping!
Go up on the hill behind the house and cut a
switch, a strong one, a long one, for a long
strong whipping, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obediently Birdling went up to the hill
where the witch-hazel bushes held out their
long, strong boughs to be cut for switches. But
somehow he could not find just the switch he
wanted; one was not long enough and another
was too long, or one would not be strong enough
and the next too strong. He looked them all
over very carefully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>The witch-hazel bushes were in blossom,
there were fuzzy little yellow stars on their
boughs; Birdling saw a bumble-bee (who should
have been in bed an hour ago) darting from
bush to bush and tasting the little flowers. Then
the boy remembered that he was to have no
supper to-night, and as he felt dreadfully hungry,
he touched one of the yellow blossoms and
licked his finger that was covered with fine
golden pollen, just to see what it tasted like.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp013.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="574" height="498" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Behold what happened to Birdling! He
did not know that the witch-hazel flowers were
full of Fairy Bread! Suddenly he grew smaller
and smaller, like a candle on a birthday-cake,
till he thought he must go out altogether&mdash;but
just before it was time to go out he stopped
shrinking and saw to his great relief that he was
still a good inch taller than the bumble-bee.</p>
<p>He sat down with surprise, hands on the
ground and feet apart, and the short grasses
closed above his head. All around him the
daisies, who always enjoy a joke, were tittering
and looking at him through the grass. Somewhere
behind a huge fuzzy mullen-plant was a
great noise, like the motor of an aeroplane&mdash;it
was the bumble-bee, coming to see what was
going on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; he boomed in his
rolling bass voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to know,&rdquo; replied the
boy, picking himself up. &ldquo;I never felt so small
in my life, not even when I tore my Sunday
shirt and my great-aunt scolded me before everybody!
Why, I&rsquo;m no bigger than a sea-horse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The daisies were still laughing and now
they could no longer contain themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ate fairy-bread,&rdquo; they giggled, &ldquo;and he
grew as little as a balloon when the air goes out,
ho, ho, ho, ho! Tee, tee, tee, tee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ate fairy-bread!&rdquo; exclaimed Birdling, &ldquo;do
you mean to say I am a fairy now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bumble-bee put his head on one side
and deliberated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a fairy.
You&rsquo;re only fairyish. What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any. But people call me Birdling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s not so bad. What can you
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. Oh, yes&mdash;I can whistle!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where will you live? You are too small
to live with your great-aunt. She would surely
step on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Birdling looked around; there was a groundsparrow&rsquo;s
nest under the witch-hazel bushes,
very near the fairy-bread flowers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;If nobody minds, I&rsquo;ll live
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So that is where he lived all summer. Everybody
on the hill grew fond of him, and in the
mornings when the robin sang to the sun, Birdling
too would be up and whistling.</p>
<p>But one day the Bumble-bee came to call.
His face was serious and his voice unusually
rumbly. It was a cool day so Birdling was all
wrapped in a mullen leaf.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp016.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="798" height="330" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Autumn!&rdquo; said Bumble. &ldquo;What will
you do when Winter comes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. What do the birds do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They go to the Fairy Islands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mayn&rsquo;t I go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t a bird or a fairy,&rdquo; objected the
visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m fairyish, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you may, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Birdling got up, ready to start at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do the birds get there, Bumble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They fly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t fly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you can&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you said I could if I was fairyish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I said you might. You may, but you
can&rsquo;t. See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Birdling shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the Fairy Islands?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;Beyond the Deep Sea.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp018.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="365" height="245" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Could one go in a boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Birdling remembered the Little Dipper,
lying forlorn on the sands, beyond the reaches
of the tide. Perhaps some boy had picked her
up, or perhaps the waves had taken her&mdash;or
perhaps she was still in her harbor!</p>
<p>Neatly he folded some mullen-leaves, for
sailors need warm clothes and blankets, and
with these over his arm he began the long
journey from the hill-top to the harbor. It was
ten fairy-miles of rather rough walking. The
Bumble-bee went with him and when they had
come as far as his great-aunt&rsquo;s house, which was
just half-way between the hill and the beach,
he flew up on her roof where you could get a
splendid view of the country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, can you see the Little Dipper?&rdquo; cried
Birdling from below.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp019.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="202" height="131" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see a boat on the sand,&rdquo; reported Bumble,
&ldquo;a very queer boat&mdash;her hull is black, her trimmings
golden-yellow, her decks bright-blue and
the mast and sails are green.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Little Dipper!&rdquo; shouted Birdling,
and began to run as fast as he could. He quite
forgot that his great-aunt sat by the window,
knitting wristlets and watching everything outside
the house. She saw the tiny creature running
along the beach, and as she was very old
and could not see very clearly through her spectacles,
she opened the window and leaned far
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be a mouse,&rdquo; she decided, and
hobbling across the room, she called her cat and
opened the door for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mousie outside, Puss!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Go
catch the Mousie, catch the Mousie!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>The big black cat never had much to eat
so he was very glad to go and catch a mouse.
Poor Birdling dropped his mullen-leaves and
ran faster and faster, but could not run fast
enough. The Cat came nearer and nearer.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp020.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="800" height="213" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t run any more!&rdquo; panted Birdling
at last. In another moment the Cat would have
pounced upon him and devoured him&mdash;but just
then the Bumble-bee came booming through
the air, and stung the Cat on his big, black,
S-shaped tail. The cat gave a terrible cry, turned
around and ran home three times as fast as he
had come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Birdling had to sit down and rest for a
while after the Cat had gone. Then he and
the Bumble-bee went on, hoping to reach the
Little Dipper before noon. But they had not
gone one-half a fairy-mile further, when a cross,
scratchy voice shouted at them: &ldquo;Get off the
beach!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Birdling timidly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
board fence on one side and water on the other,
and I can&rsquo;t go back the way I came, because
there&rsquo;s a cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could not even see who was speaking.
There was only a big brown hill in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not on the beach,&rdquo; replied Bumble-bee.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in the air. Who are you, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who am I! Well, I like that&mdash;who am I?
Why, I&rsquo;m ME!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big brown hill lifted itself up a bit, and
they saw that it was the back of a Horse-Shoe
Crab.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get off the beach, you civilians, this is a
parade-ground! I&rsquo;m drilling the new regiment
from the Deep Sea.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp022.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="800" height="217" />
</div>
<p>Then they noticed a long line of little pink
Crabs emerging from the foamy water and
slowly ascending the sands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Backward&mdash;march!&rdquo; shouted the Horse-Shoe
Crab.</p>
<p>There was nothing for Birdling to do but sit
down on an empty oyster shell and wait until
the parade was over. They marched backward,
and marked time with two feet, three feet, four
feet, till they had learned to keep all six of them
going, and they did squads right and left and
exercised their jaws and joints and pincers.
There was nothing they did not do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>At last the Horse-Shoe Crab shouted: &ldquo;Dismiss!&rdquo;
and all the little Crabs tumbled back into
the sea, pinching each other and betting who
would be first down the beach. Then the old
commander turned his attention to Birdling and
Bumble.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp023.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="800" height="201" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going at all,&rdquo; replied Bumble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to cross the parade-ground?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To get to my ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show your passport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; and Bumble unsheathed his shiny
long bayonet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; said the Horse-Shoe Crab
quickly, backing away a few steps and pulling
in his tail. &ldquo;You may pass.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>It was night before they reached the Little
Dipper. She looked very forlorn, lying a bit
sideways, sails furled and decks covered with
sand. Worst of all, a whole brotherhood of
Shrimps had set up housekeeping in her hold,
and not even at the point of Bumble&rsquo;s bayonet
would they move out. They wore little coats
of mail that made them quite indifferent to a
mere bumble-bee&rsquo;s sting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you <i>must</i> move out,&rdquo; pleaded Birdling,
standing on the deck and shouting down into
the hold. &ldquo;I want to go to the Fairy Islands,
and I simply must have my ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to the Fairy Islands?&rdquo; echoed the
Shrimps. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a long trip, without food or
water aboard and without a crew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll lay in food and water soon
enough,&rdquo; said Bumble, who sat in the rigging.
&ldquo;As for a crew&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let us be the crew,&rdquo; cried the Shrimps.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not clever, but we&rsquo;re really very obedient
and faithful. We don&rsquo;t want to spoil your trip,
Birdling, but we don&rsquo;t want to move, either;
there are very few houses along the beach, and
none as nice as this. Let us be your crew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then I&rsquo;ll have to pay you,&rdquo; said Birdling,
&ldquo;and I have no money. Shall I pay you with
music? I&rsquo;ll whistle one tune for every Shrimp
once a week.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp025.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="723" height="342" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bargain,&rdquo; replied the crew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>All night long Bumble flew to and fro between
the witch-hazel bushes on the hill and
the boat upon the beach, carrying fairy-bread
and honey-dew for the voyage. The crew
packed all these provisions into big barnacles
that made splendid kegs and barrels. Birdling
was brave enough to go back along the beach
by moonlight and pick up the mullen-leaf
blankets he had dropped when he fled from the
Cat, and at the crack of dawn the Little Dipper
was ready to put to sea. They cleared the harbor
and with the outgoing tide floated out upon
the ocean. Bumble flew above the mast and
accompanied them for several miles; two fiddler
crabs came to the edge of the beach and fiddled
until the good ship was out of sight, and Birdling
stood at the bow with the great green sail
blowing behind him. At last everybody shouted:
&ldquo;Goodby, goodby, goodluck, thank you, thank-you!,&rdquo;
then the Little Dipper sailed out of sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp027.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="353" height="265" />
</div>
<p>For three days they journeyed, always pointing
their course to Eastward, but they did not
know just where to look for the Fairy Islands.
Sometimes a flock of birds would fly above
them also going Eastward, but they flew so fast
that it was never possible to follow and learn
their path.</p>
<p>On the fourth day, just as the pink dawn
spread over the sky, Birdling saw a whole fleet
of tiny sails. They were no bigger than his own,
but they were pearly white and shimmered with
lovely colors, so he knew they must be Nautilus
ships.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heigh-ho!&rdquo; he shouted, catching up to
them. &ldquo;Heigh-ho, heigh-ho!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Nautilus ships have deep, deep holds
with many little cabins in them. When he
shouted, a whole troop of fairy sailors came
popping out to see who had called to them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;Heigh-ho!&rdquo; they replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asked Birdling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the Fairy Islands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; said the fairies. &ldquo;Who
are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Birdling, and the Shrimps are my crew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Little Dipper was surrounded by the
ships of pearl, and as the sea was quiet and the
wind very low they could talk from deck to
deck. The oldest one of the fairy captains was a
Brownie named Trick. He was seven hundred
years old, and knew about everything from the
North Pole to the great Antarctic.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp028.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="244" height="295" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to the Fairy Islands with a
cargo of ants&rsquo;-eggs,&rdquo; he told Birdling, &ldquo;Our
King likes to eat them poached, or fried, or
scrambled, on his breakfast toast. We would
do anything to cheer up the King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does the King need cheering up?&rdquo;
Birdling inquired sympathetically. &ldquo;I thought
Kings were always happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, no, no, our Fairy King is very unhappy.
His little son has been kidnapped by
Shag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Shag?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trick shook his head and rolled his eyes at
Birdling&rsquo;s ignorance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! You have sailed the Sea for fully
half a week, and don&rsquo;t know who Shag is? Ask
your crew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Shrimps did not know about Shag,
either. They were not very clever, you know,
and had not gone to school.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you please tell us?&rdquo; said Birdling, a
bit ruffled at the Brownie&rsquo;s airs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shag is the King of the Deep Sea!&rdquo; shouted
all the Fairies together, so loudly that the Nautilus
ships rocked with the noise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has kidnapped our little Fairy Prince,&rdquo;
Trick explained, &ldquo;and nobody knows whether
he is ill, or imprisoned, or dead. Our King is
so sad that he will not wear his crown, he has
locked it in a closet and hidden the key. As for
the queen, the poor lady has turned into a weeping
willow!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp030.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="579" height="415" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s awful,&rdquo; said Birdling, and the Shrimps
were moved to tears. &ldquo;Where does Shag live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the rock where the Sea Lion sleeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t somebody sneak into his house and
take a peep to see what has become of the
little Prince?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make us shiver to think of it,&rdquo; replied
the fairies, pulling their caps down over their
ears and their sailor collars up. &ldquo;The Sea-Lion
wakes at the slightest noise and catches anyone
who comes near. And if you did get by,
Shag would be sure to see you and eat you at
a gulp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Birdling went on asking questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the Rock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are just passing it,&rdquo; said a Shrimp from
the top of the mast. &ldquo;I see it, far to leeward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Birdling turned his rudder, and waved his
hand as his boat swung away from the Nautilus
fleet.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp031.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="323" height="140" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;Goodby,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Tell your King
that Birdling has gone to take a peep into Shag&rsquo;s
palace, to see whether the young Prince be ill,
or imprisoned, or dead! You shall not see me
again till I bring word of your prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fairies set up a great cry of amazement,
but already the Little Dipper was far to leeward,
steering toward the terrible Rock. So they continued
on their way to the Fairy Islands and all
the way home they could talk of nothing but
the adventurous captain of the many-colored
sail-boat, and his crew.</p>
<p>Birdling sailed straight up to the Rock. It
was black and high, and the waves ran up on
it in great white ruffles. Then he noticed that
the top of the Rock was not of stone at all&mdash;it
was the outstretched form of the Sea Lion, sound
asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>When the Shrimps saw the monster, their
courage failed them. They fell upon their knees
and begged the Skipper to turn back, for they
were dreadfully afraid of being eaten; and when
Birdling would not turn back, they mutinied and
said they would not mind the sails and would
not go one inch nearer the terrible Rock! Then
Birdling grew angry at their cowardice and
locked them all into the hold, where their cries
could not be heard, for he was afraid they would
wake the Sea Lion. He then took the ropes
and the rudder in his own hand, and steered
his craft into a cove so near the Sea Lion that
he could hear the great creature breathing.</p>
<p>In the cove and under the rock ran a deep
cave, that he guessed at once to be the entrance
to Shag&rsquo;s palace, where you could go down into
the sea without drowning, as the Mermen and
Mermaids do. Very quietly he fastened his
boat to the rock, then climbed on to the gunwale
and dived like a dolphin into the deep,
dark, ripply water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>Yes, this was the entrance to the Palace of
King Shag! At the bottom of the cave was a
winding stairway, like the inside of a huge shell.
Strange, fantastic fish swam up and down and
churned up the water so that it was very hard
for Birdling to keep his balance. But fortunately
they did not see him, so he crept on
slowly down the steps.</p>
<p>Suddenly he saw a gleam of light, and he
felt sure it must be from Shag&rsquo;s palace. Faster
and faster he ran down the wet, mossy stairs,
till a current of water caught him and took him
all the way down just as a fly goes down the
hole in a washbowl. When he landed at the
foot of the stairs, he was sitting on golden sands
and the bright lights blinded his eyes.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp034.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="366" height="488" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; said a thundering voice
in his ear, and a huge fin picked him up. He
looked up and saw Shag himself, a huge silvery
fish with long whiskers and pop-eyes and a
golden crown on his head. He was very hideous,
and Birdling was terribly frightened, but
he looked all around hoping to see the Prince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who you are,&rdquo; said Shag,
&ldquo;but you look as if you&rsquo;d make a nice little
morsel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will let you have one chance for your life.
Before I eat you, you shall come and see the
wonderful treasures I have collected, and if you
are able to pick out the most precious jewel in
my vault, I will let you go. You shall have the
jewel for a prize, and I will give you one day&rsquo;s
grace before pursuing you with my soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp035.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="799" height="460" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>So Birdling was led down some more long
stairs to the cellar of the palace, where shining
jellyfish lights hung from the ceiling. In their
dim radiance he saw a heap of treasure such as
no one had ever seen in all the world&mdash;diamonds
that shone like stars, rubies and sapphires
and emeralds, brooches and necklaces,
pearl-set combs, wonderful pins and lockets
and vessels of hammered gold!</p>
<p>Then Birdling noticed a queer locket lying
close to his foot; it seemed to be made of two
big oyster-shells closed with a band of tin.
There was nothing very precious about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it must be precious, or it wouldn&rsquo;t be
here,&rdquo; he thought quickly.</p>
<p>So, while Shag waved his whiskers in a
bored and superior way, and his soldiers craned
their necks to see Birdling, the boy suddenly
stooped and picked up the locket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I choose this,&rdquo; he said, and held it up with
both hands.</p>
<p>Shag uttered a howl of rage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;He has guessed, he has guessed!&rdquo; The
body-guard drew back in terror as their King
beat the water with his fins, till a cloud of mud
came up from the floor of the cave and his
crown slipped over one eye. Now he would
really have liked to eat up Birdling but of course
the soldiers had all heard the rules of the game,
so he had to abide by his word. Birdling was
escorted back to the hall and allowed to go up
the winding stairs, back to the Little Dipper,
the heavy oyster shell under his arm. It seemed
to him about as big as a suit-case, but harder
to carry because it had no handle. No one
knows how he could ever have carried it to the
top of the stairs, had he not met a Sea-Horse
who gave him a ride.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp037.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="476" height="630" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;Heigh-ho!&rdquo; he cried, when he stood once
more aboard the Little Dipper, &ldquo;are you asleep
or awake down there in the hold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awake!&rdquo; cried one voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asleep!&rdquo; murmured all the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then wake up, for we must flee! We have
one day of grace and then Shag will pursue us:
Heave the anchors and hoist the sails!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he raised the trap-door of the hold, and
the Shrimps climbed out, looking very shamefaced
and small, as well they might; and in a
few minutes the Little Dipper was under sail.</p>
<p>When the Rock was well out of sight and
the Little Dipper making good speed, Birdling
gave the wheel to the first mate, and decided
to open the oyster-locket. It took three Shrimps
and the captain himself to move the heavy
band of tin that held the two half-shells together.
But at last they fell apart&mdash;and what do you
suppose was inside?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>A perfect little bedroom, all wrought of
finest gold, with a canopy-bed of rosy silk and
a tiny chair and table and even a dresser&mdash;and
in the bed, on pillows of down, lay the young
Fairy Prince! When the locket opened and the
light shone into his room, he rubbed his eyes
and said: &ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time to go home,&rdquo; replied Birdling. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
be afraid, for we are taking you there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They gave him some witch-hazel bread and
a drink of honey-dew, and one of the Shrimps
was appointed to tell him stories to pass the
time. The young Prince was cheerful and well-behaved
and every one who saw him loved
him at once. He had yellow curls and bright,
laughing eyes, and clothes made of flower-petals,
that made Birdling feel very plain in his
rough coat of mullen-leaves.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp039.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="373" height="319" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Everybody aboard the Little Dipper was
perfectly happy, so they quite forgot that tomorrow
morning Shag would pursue them with
his soldiers. Imagine their terror when they
woke up at sunrise in a raging storm that made
the waves dash over the very mast of their
boat! They could hear Shag howling at the
bottom of the Deep Sea, and as he whisked his
tail he made more and more bubbles and white-caps
come up. The white-caps pursued the
Little Dipper like ranks of horsemen.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp040.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="575" height="510" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>The young prince, hidden under Birdling&rsquo;s
mullen-coat, began to tremble and cry, for he
was dreadfully afraid of Shag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; said Birdling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure
we will reach the Fairy Islands very soon now,
and then we will be safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where are the Fairy Islands? Where
are they?&rdquo; queried the young prince, scanning
the sea with his bright eyes. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see them,
and I am so frightened!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Birdling had just been hit on the head by a
hailstone, but he pretended it did not hurt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t be frightened,&rdquo; he said cheerfully.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll whistle you a tune if you&rsquo;ll stop
crying.&rdquo; And he began to whistle as though
he did not mind the storm at all.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp041.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="714" height="231" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>As he whistled, the sea became calm and
began to shimmer with a thousand lovely colors&mdash;and
out of the rippling waters rose three snow-capped
mountains surrounded on every side by
sunny green plains. He had found the Fairy
Islands!</p>
<p>Birdling ran his boat into the harbor where
he saw the Nautilus fleet lying at anchor, and
he called out joyfully, &ldquo;Yo, ho, yo, ho, heigh-ho!
Where is Trick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A crowd of fairies came running to the harbor&rsquo;s
edge, and cried, &ldquo;Hush, hush! No one is
allowed to shout or whistle or sing on this
island. Even the birds do not sing. The King
and Queen have commanded silence to prevail,
until they have some news of their son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s news for you, then,&rdquo; replied Birdling.
&ldquo;Go and tell your King and Queen that
the young prince has returned!&rdquo; So saying, he
picked up the fairy child and stood him on the
gunwale of the ship for everyone to see, and
the well-behaved child doffed his little diadem,
and bowed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp043.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="756" height="470" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>So great was the joy of the fairy people, that
they stumbled over each other in their haste to
go and tell the King that the good ship Little
Dipper had brought back his son. The queen,
who had turned into a weeping willow, came
back to life and wept now with delight; the
king hunted all over the palace for the key to
his closet, for he could hardly wait to put on
his crown once more and hold a great banquet
in honor of Birdling, who had restored the heir
to the throne. The birds burst into song and
the blue bells chimed and even the butterflies,
who are usually silent, began to trill and chirp,
until the whole island rang with joyous sounds.
As soon as the cook could get the banquet
ready they all sat down and feasted, from the
fairy King, with Birdling by his side, to the
meekest under-earthworm, and the shy Shrimps
had a table by themselves because they did
not possess very fairyish manners. There was
cake for everybody, and ice-cream, and chocolate
with whipped cream, and candy and
favors. The best thing about the party was
that all the goodies were fairy-food which
couldn&rsquo;t make you sick however much you ate,
and they all drank Birdling&rsquo;s health in pink
lemonade.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Three days later, when the feasting was
over, and the hundreds of golden dishes had
been washed and dried, Birdling was playing
on the beach with the fairies and he saw a ship
out at Sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he said to his friend Trick, &ldquo;there
is a ship just like mine, only a hundred times
bigger! That isn&rsquo;t a fairy ship. How do you
suppose she came into these waters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that is a ship which came here long
ago,&rdquo; said Trick. &ldquo;Shag caught it and tied it
to the light-house rock. It has been there
for years and years. I suppose the storm which
Shag made when he was angry at you, must
have torn the rope and set the poor vessel free.
Do you suppose the people on board are still
alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and see,&rdquo; said Birdling. &ldquo;Of course
I&rsquo;m very small, but I might be able to help
them.&rdquo; So he took the Little Dipper and sailed
out to the schooner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;Heigh-ho!&rdquo; he cried, standing up and putting
his hands to his mouth. &ldquo;Heigh-ho!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somebody certainly was alive on the ship;
a tall captain dressed in oil skins, stood up in
the bow and shouted back:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are the Big Dipper! Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Little Dipper! And you must be my
father,&rdquo; cried Birdling, dancing for joy.</p>
<p>At first the Captain could not believe his
eyes and ears, but when Birdling stood on his
right hand (he had the good ship Little Dipper
in the left one) he looked at him very closely,
and saw that it really was his son.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp046.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="473" height="426" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Father, now we can go home together,&rdquo;
exclaimed the boy, hugging his father&rsquo;s thumb.
&ldquo;But will you wait till I go and say goodby to
my fairy friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will wait,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;for
you should never leave your friends without
saying goodby and thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fairies were sorry to see Birdling go,
they let him take along all the treasures he
wanted from the King&rsquo;s storeroom, and helped
him carry them down to the harbor and put
them in his hold. He took a bag of gold for
his father and a little one for himself, besides
the oyster-locket with the golden chamber
inside, which he had won from Shag, and a
little pearly crown for his friend the Bumblebee
at home. He even took a gold thimble
for his great-aunt and a little silver bell for the
Cat, to show that he bore no malice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;And here is some fairy wine you must
drink when you are safely aboard your father&rsquo;s
ship,&rdquo; said the King, handing Birdling a tiny
vial just as he said goodby. &ldquo;It will make you
grow up again and be as big as other boys.
We will miss you, Birdling. Farewell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Birdling, a life sized boy once more,
went home with his father whistling happy
songs. As his whistle died away in the distance,
the Fairy Islands sank down into the
water, the waves closed over them, and you
could not even guess where the three snowy
peaks and the green plains and sunny harbors
had been.</p>
<p>And no one has ever seen them since.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">THE WONDERFUL TALE OF NIKKO</span></h2>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp050.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="508" height="469" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>The Emperor of China was about to choose
a bride. From far and near the fairest ladies of
the realm came to his palace. They sat on
pearly thrones which were borne on the shoulders
of Hindu slaves or drawn by spotted
leopards and some were floated down the great
rivers on rafts woven of long-stemmed Lotos
flowers.</p>
<p>Nikko stood sadly by the roadside watching
the grand procession pass. She was more
beautiful than any of the splendid ladies, but she
was poor and humble and had to work in the
rice-fields where the muddy water tickled her
little bare toes.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp051.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="401" height="460" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot work in the rice-fields to-day,&rdquo;
she said to herself, &ldquo;for the procession is so interesting
that I have to stand by the roadside and
watch. I had better go into the woods, where I
can&rsquo;t see it, and pick some mushrooms for
dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp052.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="420" height="399" />
</div>
<p>So she took her basket and went into the
woods. But before she had picked the first
handful, she saw a tremendous scarlet toadstool
spangled all over with silver dots, swaying on a
tall silvery stem. It was the most enormous
toadstool she had ever seen, so big that Nikko
could have hidden under its flapping top. She
wanted to pull it up and carry it as a parasol,
but just then she looked over the edge and
noticed that a pearly Snail and a golden Spider
were sitting on top having tea together. The
Snail turned around and stuck out his eyes at
her like opera-glasses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Nikko. &ldquo;I almost picked
your toadstool for a parasol! I didn&rsquo;t see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should a little girl want a parasol?&rdquo;
asked the Snail as solemnly as a great-aunt.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very vain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no indeed,&rdquo; replied Nikko. &ldquo;But I
should like to pretend I was a grand lady, going
to the Emperor&rsquo;s palace to-day. I should love
to see the Emperor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So should I,&rdquo; said the Spider.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so should I,&rdquo; admitted the Snail.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but look at me!&rdquo; cried Nikko sadly.
&ldquo;I have on a hempen frock and my feet are
bare and I have not a single jewel, only this
string of red berries round my neck! But to ride
in the procession one must sit on a pearly throne
and wear a silken gown and jewelry and carry
a pretty parasol. I have none of these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will make you a dress more beautiful
than silk,&rdquo; said the Spider, &ldquo;if you will take me
along to see the Emperor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I could take the toadstool for a parasol,
if you wouldn&rsquo;t mind having tea somewhere
else,&rdquo; Nikko said. &ldquo;But alas! what should I do
for a pearly throne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now you mention it,&rdquo; chimed in the
Snail, &ldquo;if I could eat enough tea and toast I
might grow big enough to carry you, and my
house would make a pretty good throne. Yes,
perhaps I&rsquo;ll carry you, if you will get me the tea
and toast; for I must confess I should love to see
the Emperor!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>As fast as her bare feet could carry her,
Nikko ran home, took all the tea out of the canister,
baked six batches of bread, put them in a
bucket and carried them back to the forest.
She then laid a fire of sticks and began to make
toast so ambitiously that the scent of it could be
smelled all over China from the Great Wall at
one end to the Yellow Sea at the other. And
above the fire hung the bucket, filled with water
for the Snail&rsquo;s tea.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp055.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="800" height="758" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>The Snail filled his acorn-cup a million times
that day and ate toast till the sun went down.
Then he rested for a few minutes, but when
night came he began again and you could hear
him munching in the dark.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp056.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="736" height="311" />
</div>
<p>In the morning he was so big that he had to
descend from the toadstool for fear of breaking
its stem. By evening he was as big as a football,
and by the next morning as big as the
biggest snow-ball you ever made, and before
the third day, he was big enough to carry Nikko
on his back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Meanwhile the Spider had been very busy.
He had spun a wonderful silken gown, all decked
with dew-drops and inwrought with the wings
of butterflies, and when he had watched Nikko
put it on and made sure that it fitted perfectly,
he fastened himself in front for a brooch. Nikko
was delighted. But suddenly she exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, I have no shoes! The grand ladies
all wear tiny beaded shoes. What shall I do
with my feet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind your feet,&rdquo; replied the Snail.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be riding all the time so you can keep
them tucked under your gown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they picked the scarlet toadstool for a
parasol, set Nikko a-top the Snail with her feet
well hidden, and started on their way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>The procession was almost over; only a few
stragglers hurried along the highroad, and they
all overtook poor Nikko, for a Snail can go just
half a mile an hour and no faster. A haughty
four-in-hand of peacocks passed her at a strut,
tails spread and crests erect; a team of pig-tailed
Chinamen running for all they were worth and
jolting their mistress till she was dizzy, almost
stumbled headlong over the Snail; four turbaned
slaves overtook her and then looked back open-mouthed
at the beautiful lady; and a spotted
leopard, loping in front of a gorgeous princess&rsquo;
throne, shied in terror when the Snail happened
to stick out his eyes, and the leopard, the throne
and the gorgeous princess were wrecked in the
muddy water of the rice-field beside the road.</p>
<p>When they came to the palace they heard
the bells ringing, the big gongs sounding and the
conches blowing, and saw great kites and paper
lanterns and balloons swinging in the air, for the
Emperor had just chosen a bride and the procession
was all over! The bride was the beautiful
lady Lu Tsing, who now sat beside him on
the terrace and smiled down on all the other
ladies. Her maidens and attendants sat at her
feet and told her how fortunate she was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;How did you feel when you rode in the
procession?&rdquo; asked one of the maidens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you dreadfully excited till you
knew whom his Majesty would choose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Tsing yawned behind her fan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t a bit excited,
for I knew of course that he would choose me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp059.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="527" height="509" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Just then the big Snail came plodding along
the road, and they all got a glimpse of Nikko&rsquo;s
face under the scarlet parasol. She was so lovely
to behold that everybody gasped. But the Emperor
did more than gasp; he jumped up from
his ivory chair and cried,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends, Courtiers, Chinamen! I have
changed my mind! I am not going to marry
Lu Tsing after all, but this unknown damsel
whose name has never been heard in the land!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the bells were tolled and the gongs
sounded and the conches blown louder than
ever, as a hundred slaves hurried down the steps
to pick up Nikko&rsquo;s throne and carry her up to
the terrace. Then the Snail withdrew into his
house, for he was ticklish, and the Spider whispered
to Nikko under cover of all the noise:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not be found with a real spider
on your breast! I will leave you now, and you
can say you have lost your pin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>With these words he dropped to the ground
and ran when he thought no one would notice.
But one person did notice; that was the lady
Lu Tsing. She tried to kill him with her foot,
but he escaped again and again, till suddenly
she picked up a cup from the tea-table, turned
it up-side down and trapped him under it.</p>
<p>The Emperor greeted Nikko with honeyed
words, but the lady Lu Tsing having caught the
Spider, retreated to the furthest, darkest chamber
of the palace, where she tore up all the curtains
and bed-spreads and bureau-scarfs in her wrath
till the room looked like a rag-man&rsquo;s house.
Then she sat down among the wreckage and
plotted revenge.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp061.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="551" height="439" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Nikko would have been quite happy if she
had not been so worried about her bare feet.
Sooner or later they would be discovered and
oh, what would the Emperor think of her then?
Just now he took her hand and said to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, you must tell me what you would
like for a wedding gift!&rdquo; And Nikko almost
cried out: &ldquo;Shoes, your Majesty, shoes!&rdquo; but
she did not want to give herself away, so she
replied,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I do not know which I would rather
have, a bright brocaded shawl or a new pair of
slippers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have both,&rdquo; declared the Emperor,
and ordered a maiden to fetch them.
Nikko donned the shawl and slipped on the
little shoes but they were so small that they hurt
her feet dreadfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah well,&rdquo; she said to herself, biting back
tears of pain. &ldquo;I shall have to get used to some
discomforts now that I am to be an Empress!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had been Empress for about a week,
when her husband the Emperor fell very ill. It
really was indigestion after the wedding-feast,
but of course the doctors wanted to make it
something more dignified, so they said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have been bitten by a poisonous
insect!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp063.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="580" height="348" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I know who it was,&rdquo; said Lu Tsing
to her attendants. &ldquo;It was the golden Spider
who sat on Nikko&rsquo;s breast when she came!
Everybody thought it was a pin, but it really
was a Spider, for I saw him creep away!&rdquo; and
the attendants went about the palace telling
everybody how Nikko had worn a live Spider
for a pin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>Nikko was very anxious about her husband.
He lay on a couch in the parlor because he was
too ill to sit on his throne, and twenty doctors
stood around and told him that a poisonous
insect must have bitten him. Just then Lu Tsing
came in, with a tea-cup in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold what the maid found in his Majesty&rsquo;s
bed when she turned the mattress!&rdquo; she cried,
And showed them the golden Spider, who sat
in the tea-cup and looked at them with great
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it is the Spider that Nikko wore when
she came,&rdquo; said the Emperor. &ldquo;We all thought
it was a pin. And she said she had lost it.
Nikko, you were fibbing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was fibbing,&rdquo; Nikko admitted.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">
<img src="images/pp064fp.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="620" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;Friends, Courtiers, Chinamen! I have changed my mind&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;And then she put the Spider into your
Majesty&rsquo;s bed!&rdquo; cried all the people. &ldquo;She is
a wicked woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In vain Nikko protested. Lu Tsing&rsquo;s attendants
had told the story so often that everybody
was ready to believe it now that they saw the
Spider.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Spider shall be killed, and Nikko be
put into the highest, strongest, darkest tower,
with a moat around it, and kept there all her
life,&rdquo; said the Emperor in great anger, &ldquo;and Lu
Tsing shall be Empress of China!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they set the Spider down on the floor
and called a hundred slaves to come with
brooms and kill him. But the hundred slaves all
hit each other&rsquo;s brooms and got so mixed up
that they did not hit the Spider at all, so he hid
under the Emperor&rsquo;s couch and when nobody
was looking he ran away. He ran to the back-yard
where the extra thrones and the Emperor&rsquo;s
beasts were kept.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Here the Snail was just having an argument
with a quick-tempered Dragon about which
was better, tea or toast. The Dragon said tea.
The Snail said toast.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp066.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="800" height="326" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stop arguing,&rdquo; said the Spider. &ldquo;The best
food is rice anyway.&rdquo; And while the Dragon
was still switching his tail and shouting: &ldquo;Tea,
tea, tea!&rdquo; the Snail stopped and listened to the
story of Nikko&rsquo;s trouble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is awful,&rdquo; he said, looking forward
with one eye and back with the other to make
sure nobody was listening. &ldquo;Have they put
Nikko in the tower?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they have,&rdquo; wept the Spider.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t she let herself out of the window?
You could creep in and spin a rope for her.
She&rsquo;s not very heavy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is a deep moat around the tower,&rdquo;
said the Spider. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t get to her, and
besides if she let herself down she would drop
into the moat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you below,&rdquo; replied the Snail. &ldquo;You
be ready to do your part. Meet me to-night at
the edge of the moat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then one of the slaves appeared with a
broom, so the little spider ducked out of sight
under a throne. The Snail sat in deep thought
for a while; then he went and found the Dragon
again, and told him that toast was better than tea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>At night, when the temple-bells had stopped
ringing and everyone in the palace was fast
asleep, the Snail and the Spider met at the edge
of the moat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hop on my back,&rdquo; whispered the Snail,
and slid into the water with the Spider aboard.
Softly he floated across the black moat to the
tower where Nikko was imprisoned.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp068.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="510" height="332" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>Poor Nikko sat weeping by the window.
It was cold and dusty and untidy in the tower-room.
She had pulled the brocaded shawl
tight about her shoulders and had taken off her
tiny shoes, for now that she was no longer an
Empress she thought she might as well be
comfortable. Her parasol lay up-side-down in
a corner for she never expected to use it again.
The sun never shone in the tower where she
was to stay all her life.</p>
<p>How surprised she was when a small voice
called: &ldquo;Nikko, Empress of China!&rdquo; and looking
up, she discovered the golden spider sitting on
the window-sill!</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must hurry,&rdquo; he said, and began to
spin a rope. He was all out of breath from
running up the high steep wall of the tower.
When he had finished the rope, Nikko put on
her shoes and picked up the parasol, the Spider
hopped on her shoulder, and together they let
themselves carefully out of the window. The
rope was very slippery and they slid down a
little faster than they intended.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Splash! they landed on the back of the
Snail and ducked him completely under water,
but he bobbed right up again. They floated
across the moat in the moonlight and the spider
climbed on top of the parasol and kept the
watch, for the Snail kept getting his eyes full of
water, and Nikko was so busy holding on that
she could not look around at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care,&rdquo; said the Spider, &ldquo;someone is
coming! Thank goodness, here we are ashore.
But I&rsquo;m afraid somebody has seen us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Snail crawled out of the water and
shook himself, stretched his eyes and paused for
breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run away, Nikko,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I should
like to carry you, but my pace is too slow. You
had better trust to your feet. Hurry, hurry and
flee from the land of China, or the Emperor&rsquo;s
soldiers will catch you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t leave you,&rdquo; protested Nikko.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you must leave me. I will follow by
and by and meet you in the big world beyond
China, for no one will think about me or try to
catch me. Take the Spider with you. Buddha
preserve you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp071.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="544" height="366" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>So Nikko and the Spider kissed him goodbye
and ran away together, over muddy fields
of rice and big dry fields of black poppies,
past temples and villages till they came to the
furthest end of the country. It was lucky they
had not waited for the Snail, for no sooner were
they out of sight of the palace than they heard
the Emperor&rsquo;s soldiers coming after them.
Somebody really had seen them in the moat;
it was the Dragon, who had drunk so much
tea the day before that he could not sleep that
night and was prowling through the yard looking
for the Snail. He wanted to have another
argument to pass the time. But when he discovered
the Snail in the moat, carrying Nikko
away from the tower, he did not stop to argue&mdash;he
ran straight to the Emperor&rsquo;s room, and
told him what he had seen.</p>
<p>Nikko ran as fast as she could, ducking
under the tea-plants whenever she had to stop
and rest. She lost one shoe in the deep mud,
so she took off the other one too and carried it
in her hand, glad to be barefoot again. The
tea-plants tore her gown, but every time there
was a fresh rent the Spider promptly mended it.</p>
<p>Thus they came to the great Wall of China,
and there they had to stop. The gates were
locked and the wall was much, much too high
to climb over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, we have you now!&rdquo; shouted the
soldiers, catching up and swinging their swords
most grandly.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp073.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="480" height="354" />
</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp073a.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="798" height="344" />
</div>
<p>But just then there came a mighty puff of
wind that pulled hard at Nikko&rsquo;s parasol. She
held on with all her might, and the wind picked
her up and wafted her high, high into the air,
and carried her clean over the wall! The soldiers
dropped their swords in amazement, and stood
with mouths agape, but there was nothing they
could do for the gate was locked and Nikko
escaped under their very noses. They could
only pick up their swords and go home again,
with their pig-tails dangling foolishly behind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>In a great forest outside the land of China,
the parasol came to earth. Nikko planted it in
the ground to let it grow as a toadstool once
more. When it rained she sat underneath it,
and by and by the Spider made curtains all
around, so that she had a lovely little house to
live in.</p>
<p>About three months later, when they had
given up all hope of ever seeing the Snail again
and the Spider had hung a black crepe on the
door in his memory, they heard a rustle among
the tea-plants, and saw his pearly shell plodding
through the forest!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Snail, sitting down heavily,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I never want to go travelling again!
The roads are really dreadful in China, and the
baggage problem is terrible!&rdquo; It had taken him
two months to make the trip, and he had to
wait another month for the great gate to be
opened, for it is only opened once a year, and
anyone who wants to come in or go out has to
wait for that day.</p>
<p>But they were so happy to be reunited again
that they soon forgot all their troubles. The
Snail lived in his house and Nikko in hers, and
the Spider had Nikko&rsquo;s old shoe for a bungalow.
Every afternoon Nikko received her
friends on the little lawn between the three
houses, where she spread the bright brocaded
shawl and served them tea in the most imperial
fashion. When it was time to go they would
make a bow and say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodnight, Empress, Buddha preserve your
Majesty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am not an Empress any more!&rdquo; said
Nikko sadly. &ldquo;Lu Tsing is Empress of China.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh well,&rdquo; replied the Snail, &ldquo;Lu Tsing may
be Empress of China, but I&rsquo;m sure you are
Empress of everywhere else!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is that?&rdquo; asked the Spider.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lazybones,&rdquo; said the Snail with his great-auntliest
air, &ldquo;look it up on the map!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they continued to bow, and the Spider
(who didn&rsquo;t look it up) embroidered a little
sampler with these words on it and fastened it
over Nikko&rsquo;s door:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Here under curtains magnificent dwells</p>
<p class="t0">Nikko, the Empress of Everywhere Else!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>Once upon a time there was a man who
lived in a dark hut under a willow tree. His face,
and his wife&rsquo;s face, and the faces of their six
black-haired children, were as dark and gnarled
as the willow trunk. But when their seventh
son was born, he was a light-haired boy, with
clear blue eyes, and a smile like golden sunshine.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp079.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="307" height="338" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is not our child!&rdquo; cried the black-eyed
man and the black-eyed woman; &ldquo;this yellow-haired
baby is a changeling; the dwarfs have
put him into the cradle!&rdquo; So they called him
Peter Dwarf. They were very unkind to him,
and when he grew older they made him do
hard, ugly work, like picking nettles and killing
lambs. Peter liked to work, but he did not at
all like to kill poor little lambs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp080.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="711" height="404" />
</div>
<p>One day it happened that the cat got into
the larder and ate a big piece of meat. The
black-eyed woman took her by the tail and
flung her out of the window at Peter Dwarf,
telling him that he must get rid of her at once.
But when he had the lovely white cat in his
arms, she looked at him so pleadingly that tears
came into his eyes, and he said: &ldquo;Minka, I cannot
hurt you! But if I don&rsquo;t obey, my father
and mother will be very angry.&rsquo;&rdquo; But the cat
still looked at him so sorrowfully that he said:
&ldquo;Minka, let us both run away. You shall not
be harmed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>They walked over many fields where corn
and beans grew in rows and the rabbits jumped
away as they came. When night fell they had
reached a mountain, and there were no more
fields, only roots and rocks and shadowy trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go into a cave to sleep,&rdquo; Peter Dwarf
suggested. So they crept into a deep cavern,
which seemed to have no end. Peter spread
his coat and lay down; but Minka crept into all
the dark crannies mewing and scratching, and
finally she disappeared. When Peter heard
her come back again, he could only see her
eyes, shining like stars in the rocky passage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; he cried, and the cavern echoed,
&ldquo;does this vault go on into the mountain? I
must see how far it goes.&rdquo; So he took up his
coat and followed Minka. Presently they were
in the heart of the hill. The caves were cold
and damp, and it was very dark. Then Peter,
shuddering, turned around to go back, but he
was entirely lost among the winding passages,
and the white cat walked aimlessly from one
cavern to another. At last, after much wandering,
they saw a light, and at the same time
they heard voices&mdash;little buzzing voices, that
sounded like a copper dish when you strike it
and set it ringing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are coming this way!&rdquo; whispered
Peter Dwarf. &ldquo;Look, they have lanterns&mdash;they
will save us. But who are they?&mdash;Minka, they
are the Diggerfolk&mdash;the Dwarfs!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Presently they came, and their lanterns made
shadowy circles on the walls. They were little
men, in gay, patched clothes, and their faces
were brown and wrinkled like walnuts. They
stopped, raised their arms, and pointed at Peter,
crying all together:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a mortal! Here is a child of mortals,
in our own native caverns!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp083.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="434" height="425" />
</div>
<p>Now Peter had gone many hours without
anything to eat, and the darkness and hunger
had made him shaky. His knees gave way
under him and he sank down on the stone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Diggerfolk, Diggerfolk, have mercy on
us! We are lost, and hungry, and have not a
friend in the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little men all muttered and grunted; they
did not look unkind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked one of them who
carried a great stone hammer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Peter Dwarf,&rdquo; replied the boy, bowing
his fair, bright head. &ldquo;And this&rdquo;&mdash;he drew
the white cat into his arms&mdash;&ldquo;this is Minka.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter Dwarf!&rdquo; exclaimed the one with the
hammer, &ldquo;why do they call you Dwarf? You
are as tall and well-shaped a boy as ever I have
seen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp084.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="638" height="452" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because I have blue eyes and yellow hair,&rdquo;
Peter replied, &ldquo;I was so different from my
brothers, and so ugly that my mother said I was
not her own son, but a fairy changeling whom
the dwarfs have put into the cradle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, ho!&rdquo; cried a big dwarf with a bunch
of keys at his belt, &ldquo;so they have sent you back
where you came from, have they? And do we
look as though we were your relatives? No,
no, little boy; take up that purring friend of
yours and go home to your mother and tell her
that this is no place either for her child or her
pussy-cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter was still kneeling on the ground, and
Minka sat between his knees. Now he stretched
his arms toward the little men, and implored:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh good kind Diggerfolk, let me go with
you and work for you! My mother has not
sent me; I ran away, because I would not hurt
Minka, and they would have been very angry
with me. I will work for you from morning
until night, only let me stay!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp086.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="800" height="462" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Work?&rdquo; said the dwarf with the hammer,
&ldquo;how can such a slight and princely creature
work? Peter, let me see your hands.&rdquo; He felt
Peter&rsquo;s hands; they were thin and strong and
callous. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this boy knows what
it is to work, I think we had better let him stay
with us. And now, Peter, since you are coming
with us, let us have a general introduction.
My name is Stroke,&rdquo; and he bowed as best he
could over his round stomach. &ldquo;I am a Swordsmith,
and he with the pick-axe is a Miner,
Mushroom by name; he of the pointed ears is
Berry, the Blacksmith; and those three who are
talking to the Lady Minka, are Hump, the
Goldsmith, Crow the Coppersmith, and Wisely,
he that jingles the keys&mdash;a Locksmith.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp087.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="800" height="517" />
</div>
<p>Peter got up and bowed to the little men.
They told him to follow, then they led the way
through winding passages down to the very
center of the earth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, if you will truly learn the trades,&rdquo;
they said, &ldquo;you must work with each one of us for
a year. You shall be given plenty to eat, and
shall sleep beside the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Peter worked for the first year with
Mushroom, the Miner. They would go into
the shafts together and break the good ore out
of the crags, letting the pieces roll with a noise
like thunder down into the cave where Thorn,
the Smelter, kept his furnace glowing.</p>
<p>The next year Peter worked for Thorn, the
Smelter, and his face became a ruddy brown
from standing over the roaring furnaces; then
he learned from Berry, the Blacksmith, how to
make hammers and axes and other tools; and the
next year he helped Stroke to fashion swords
and armor. He made gold chains and brooches
and rings with Hump, and keys with Wisely,
the Locksmith. Before the seventh year was
over, there was not a lock in all Christendom
which Peter could not open.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;Keys,&rdquo; said Wisely, stroking his silken
beard, &ldquo;Keys are the most magic things in all
the world. You have learned your trades well,
Peter Dwarf; now we will let you go forth into
the world and try your luck. And because you
have been faithful and sweet-natured, you shall
have a gift of magic. This gift shall be that
whenever you stand in another person&rsquo;s shoes,
you will be able to see what that person sees
and know what that person knows. Now use
your magic as you will, and do not forget us.
Good-bye, Peter Dwarf, good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the little dwarfs waved their caps and
their big brown hands, as Peter and Minka
went back to the sunny upper Earth, which
they had not seen for seven years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>They wandered for a long time, when finally
they came to the hut where Peter had been born,
but strange people lived in it now&mdash;his wicked
black-eyed family had all died; the woman of
a cat-bite, the man of a dog-bite, and the six
naughty boys of over-eating. So Peter and his
white Pussy walked on for many miles and
came to a splendid palace where a king lived
with his queen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Minka!&rdquo; said Peter, quite breathlessly,
&ldquo;if one could only look inside for one single
moment! Wouldn&rsquo;t you love to look inside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mew-ew,&rdquo; said the cat, rubbing her head
against his bare ankles. &ldquo;Mew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then a fat gentleman, in blue and gold
attire, came running down the hillside, as fast
as he could run. He stopped to catch his
breath, and then started again. He was the
king&rsquo;s chamberlain. Peter bowed and spoke
to him. &ldquo;Sir, is there anything I can do for
you? If it is an errand, I am a swift runner!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed you should be swifter than I,&rdquo;
groaned the chamberlain. &ldquo;Oh what a stitch I
have; what a stitch! Yes, run if you will, and
summon all the doctors in the land, and all the
wise philosophers; for the King is very ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Peter ran, as fast as only a bare-foot boy
can run; and soon he came to a house that bore
a sign:</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp091.jpg" alt="DR. FAUSTUS PH.D" width="684" height="606" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>He drummed on the door until the old magician
came out, pipe in hand, to ask what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King is very ill!&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;Go
swiftly to the palace, good doctor, and find out
what ails him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All afternoon Peter ran on and on, hunting
up physicians and wise men and sending them
to the palace. At night he returned to the
palace and the blue-and-gold gentleman called
him into the banquet hall. Peter&rsquo;s heart beat
high as he entered the shining room which was
lit by a thousand candles. Timidly he stood in
the doorway, his red pointed cap in his hands
and the white cat at his heels.</p>
<p>He almost lost his breath when the Queen
stepped through the great portal of gold. She
was arrayed in crimson silk, with red roses in her
black hair, and tiny silver slippers on her feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp093.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="486" height="477" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who is the little ragamuffin hiding behind
the Lord Chamberlain?&rdquo; demanded the Queen,
spying Peter Dwarf. &ldquo;Send him here, I would
speak with him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter approached, frightened and dazed,
and dropped upon one knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; he replied to her questioning,
&ldquo;I am Peter Dwarf; the kind Lord Chamberlain
has permitted me to enter the hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like this boy,&rdquo; said the Queen to the stout
Lord Chamberlain. &ldquo;Put him into proper clothes
and send him back to me; he shall be my page.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>So they took Peter through many snow-white
rooms to a little room in the back of the
palace. In it were a bed and chairs made of
rosewood, and roses painted on the walls, and
silver stars on the ceiling; so that when you lay
in bed you felt as though you were in a bower,
looking up at the starry sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is your room,&rdquo; said the servant who
had brought him in. &ldquo;And these are the clothes
you are to wear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter took off his leather apron and his red
cap, and put on a doublet and hose of light blue
silk, and a mantle of dark blue velvet. But
happy as he was in his rich attire, he did not
forget about the king who was so ill. Every
time he met somebody who might know, he
asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is his Majesty any better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was always the answer, &ldquo;He is very ill.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>At last the kind Lord Chamberlain told
Peter what the doctors had said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some wicked enemy of the King,&rdquo; he reported,
&ldquo;is burning a waxen image of his
majesty over a slow fire; and as long as the
image lasts the King will live, but when it has
all melted he will die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can it be?&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;Does no
one know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody knows except the wicked person
himself. We think&mdash;but say not that I told you&mdash;we
think it is someone in this very palace, for
the good King has no enemies among his
neighbors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Peter remembered the magic
power that the dwarfs had given him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me try on everybody&rsquo;s shoes,&rdquo; he cried,
&ldquo;and when I come to the shoes of the wicked
person I shall know where the waxen image is
melting!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp096.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="765" height="257" />
</div>
<p>The Lord Chamberlain gave him permission
to creep into every bedroom and dressing room
in the palace. Minka always went ahead, and
when anyone was in the room she waved her
tail to warn Peter away, but when the chamber
was empty, she said, &ldquo;Mew,&rdquo; and then Peter
went in and tried on all the shoes he could find.
But all the knowledge that came to him was a
lot of little foolish secrets&mdash;where the Lady
Natalia kept her jewels, and the Lord Richard
had ridden over a chicken and had not paid
the poor farmer a penny for it, and that the little
chambermaid Clarissa was in love with a beggar-man.
But he could not find out where the
waxen image was melting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Meanwhile he hardly saw the Queen at all.
She was always with the King, bathing his forehead,
smoothing his pillow, and getting his
chicken broth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said the chamberlain and the doctors,
&ldquo;how much she loves him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day the King was tired of having so
many people about him, and sent everybody
away but the Queen and Peter who had come
in to fill the lamps. The Queen was stroking
the poor King&rsquo;s forehead. She had forgotten
that Peter was in the room. As soon as he
was asleep she doubled up her lovely white
hand and shook her fist at him, whispering:
&ldquo;Melt&mdash;melt&mdash;melt! Another night and you
are done!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>Peter thought his heart would stand still.
Had he really heard aright? He crept out of
the room as quietly as he had come, and
hastened to the Queen&rsquo;s dressing room. Never
had it occurred to him to try on <i>her</i> shoes! He
attempted to open the door; it was locked. So
he turned sadly to his own room, and sat down
to think it over.</p>
<p>Presently a valet came in with a message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are to wait on the Queen at dinner tonight,&rdquo;
it read. Peter obeyed, and thought
little more about it. But when the Queen was
seated he stood behind her chair and he noticed
that she slipped her silver shoe off under the
table. Deftly he stepped out of his own, and
while she was helping herself to pink ice cream,
he tried to push his foot into her little shoe.
But alas! the shoe was so small that he could
not even get his toes into it! He tried and
tried, but in vain; he had to give it up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>That night he walked disconsolately with
Minka in the garden. They were just under
the Queen&rsquo;s window when suddenly, the casement
was opened, and something which looked
like a fiery rocket or a shooting star flew out
into the air&mdash;over their heads.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp099.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="663" height="493" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;A witch!&rdquo; cried Peter, and then, &ldquo;The
Queen!&rdquo; For at that very moment a silver
slipper fell beside him in the grass. When he
had stepped into it at dinner, trying to stand in
it for just one moment, he had stretched it so
much that now it was too big for the Queen.</p>
<p>As it fell Minka made a leap for it and tapped
it with her paws&mdash;but no sooner was her
little white foot inside the slipper then she began
to wave her tail violently. She too had the
magic gift of the Dwarfs!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you know,&rdquo; cried Peter, as he
followed her down the garden walks. &ldquo;I believe
you know where the waxen image is
melting!&rdquo; Peter took the slipper from Minka
and she ran ahead swiftly and quietly, and led
him over the fields and fences to a high, dark
mountain. At the foot of the mountain stood
a tower of granite, with great iron doors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mew-ew,&rdquo; said Minka, as she came up
against the iron doors. &ldquo;Mew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter tried to force the door but it was
strongly locked and would not move. Then he
peered through the key-hole, and saw a reddish
light, like the glow of a great fire. A voice
that sounded like the Queen&rsquo;s was chanting a
dismal verse and Peter knew from what she
said that the image would be melted by dawn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Peter to his cat, &ldquo;I know what
we must do; but it must be quick work! Oh
Minka&mdash;one more dawn, and it will be too late!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp101.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="266" height="369" />
</div>
<p>He went into a cavern at the foot of the
mountain. Here he called loudly down the
dark passage way&mdash;&ldquo;O Mushroom, Thorn,
Stroke, Wisely! Help me&mdash;help me&mdash;help
me!&rdquo; And in another minute he saw little
lights approaching from all parts of the mountain,
as the faithful Diggerfolk came to his call.</p>
<p>Swiftly they set up a workshop, smelted the
broken ore, hammered and polished and labored
as only Dwarfs can. As the first streaks of
light showed in the sky, they finished their
work. Peter, who had taken off his silken
clothes and put on a leather apron, now changed
to the new suit of mail they had wrought and
parted hastily from his friends with grateful
thanks. Besides the armor, they had made him
a sword, and most important of all a key to fit
the iron doors. Soon he reached the tower
again and putting the key into the lock he used
all his strength and finally the great doors
swung open.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Before him in the tower-chamber burned a
mighty fire; the flames jumped up around something
that seemed like a human figure, stretched
directly above them&mdash;but if you looked twice
you saw it was a statue of wax, rapidly melting
away. Over it the Queen was murmuring incantations
while she watched the figure grow
smaller and smaller at every lick of the cruel
flames.</p>
<p>Suddenly the white cat leaped at the Queen
and began to scratch her. This gave Peter time
to put out the fire and save the waxen image
before it was quite melted.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming, Minka, I&rsquo;m coming!&rdquo; he cried,
as the Queen seized her by the throat and tried
to choke her. Minka fought valiantly, until
Peter rushed forward and cut off the Queen&rsquo;s
head with a single stroke of his sword. At
that moment everything grew dark; a noise like
thunder came from the depth of the mountain
and Peter clasped his hands over his eyes, for
he did not want to see any more.</p>
<p>When he looked up again, the sun had risen.
Light flooded the room, and a wonderful lady,
clad in white samite as soft and pure as Minka&rsquo;s
fur, stood before him in the shining dawn. She
held out her hands, and shaking back her golden
hair said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter Dwarf, my good sweet Peter, I am
the Princess Minka; don&rsquo;t you recognize me?&rdquo;
Then Peter looked into her starry eyes, and
knew that his beloved Minka must have been
enchanted by the wicked Queen many years
ago, and that now the spell was broken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>So they returned swiftly to the royal palace,
where they found everybody rejoicing because
the King was so much better that that morning
he had eaten four buckwheat cakes with syrup
for his breakfast. And the King dubbed Peter
a knight and made him general of his army and
for a wedding present gave him a palace with a
great rose-garden and a banquet hall. Soon
after this Peter and Minka were married. When
the good King died, many years later, they were
made King and Queen, and ruled in peace and
happiness all the rest of their days.</p>

<p>Once upon a time in distant Orient Land,
there lived a beautiful royal maiden, the Princess
Zarashne. Her hair was long and black
as the veils of night, her arms were fair as the
pink sea-shells, and her gowns were as glorious
in color as the feathers of the peacock. Everybody
in the palace where she lived, and in the
town outside the palace-walls, loved Princess
Zarashne; even the animals who dwelt far
away in the desert had heard how good and
beautiful she was, and many of them came to
town hoping they might see her&mdash;the lion and
the tiger, and the striped zebra, the ostrich and
the camel and the curious giraffe. But the
keeper of the palace-gate was afraid to let them
in, so the only ones who saw her were the
ostrich and the giraffe, because they could look
over the wall and watch her feed her gold-fish
in the fountain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp108.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="554" height="468" />
</div>
<p>Most of all she was beloved by the Prince
of all Orient Land, Selim Pasha the Proud (a
Pasha is a very mighty kind of Prince, who
wears a turban of heavenly blue and carries a
curved sword in his golden belt). Selim Pasha
rode through the gates of the Palace every
morning at sunrise, on a snow-white horse,
followed by a hundred soldiers on foot; on his
shoulder he always carried a bird of paradise,
who made sweet music for Princess Zarashne,
and in his pocket he brought his pet white
mouse to dance for her. All day long he
walked with her in the garden and told her
stories about the world outside the wall, where
great rivers flowed, and palm-trees grew, and
the yellow desert sand stretched from one end
of Orient Land to the other. The only thing
he did not tell her about was the terrible
magician, who lived among the desert sands;
he did not want to tell her anything that would
give her bad dreams.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp109.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="800" height="492" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>The magician was a very mighty and ancient
man, called Bulbo. By his strange, black magic
he had built himself an impregnable castle and
had tamed a great river, and made it surround
his castle with a deep, impassable moat. No
army could ever pass these waters, or scale his
ramparts of yellow sand; if he himself wanted
to go out, he rode on the back of a big brown
bat. All the creatures of Night, the bats and
owls and toads and many wicked faery sprites,
dwelt with him in his castle and were his body-guard.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp110.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="585" height="256" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>Now it happened that Bulbo the Magician
had left his castle and was riding through the
air high over Orient Land, in the night-time, as
was his wont. He was unusually far from
home; in fact, the first light of dawn surprised
him just as his bat was fluttering over the royal
gardens. The nightingale had stopped singing,
and the birds of day had begun, the pansies
and daisies and dreamy lotos-flowers were just
waking up. Then he saw what seemed to him
the loveliest flower of all&mdash;it was Princess
Zarashne sitting alone beside the gold-fish
fountain, waiting for Selim Pasha.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp111.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="561" height="467" />
</div>
<p>Bulbo spurred his bat, and swooped down
among the rose-bushes like a swift, black
shadow. Before Princess Zarashne knew what
had happened, he had seized her and placed
her before him in the saddle between the fluttering
wings of the bat, and they were rising
up, up, up into the blue morning air!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>But just at this moment, the palace-gates
swung open, and with a flourish of trumpets
and a shout of greeting, Selim Pasha and his
soldiers appeared. Great was their horror and
dismay when they found the garden empty,
and heard Princess Zarashne cry &ldquo;Help, help!&rdquo;
far above their heads! Selim Pasha bared his
sword and tried to reach the bat as it rose, but
in vain&mdash;in the twinkling of an eye, the sorcerer
had flown a thousand miles away.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic5">
<img src="images/pp112fp.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="627" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;Bore her away to his castle in the desert&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>In Bulbo&rsquo;s palace, Princess Zarashne found
herself a prisoner. She was not cruelly treated,
for Bulbo liked her and made her queen of his
household. She had nothing to do but water
the dark poppies and nightshade and beautiful
poisonous berry-bushes that grew in his garden,
and make necklaces of the pearls and shells
that the river laid at her feet on the yellow
sands. But she was very unhappy, for her only
companion was a monkey who followed her
about as her servant, carrying her tea-cup and
her shawls and never saying a word; and she
wept to think of the days when Selim Pasha
had walked with her by the gold-fish fountain,
while the white mouse danced and the bird of
paradise sang to her&mdash;for she never hoped to
see the Prince of all Orient Land again.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Selim Pasha the Proud was inconsolable
without his beloved Princess. His
soldiers could not help him against Bulbo&rsquo;s
power, and no prophet, no wise man, no general
could tell him how to get Princess Zarashne
back. So he put on a black cloak, and put
black ashes on his turban, and would not be
comforted. When his people saw him in the
street, and shouted: &ldquo;Hail, Selim Pasha the
Proud!&rdquo; he would hide his face in his cloak
and say:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, do not call me the Proud&mdash;I am only
Poor Selim Pasha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the people were very sad, and even
the animals outside the gates felt mournful.
The crocodiles in the rivers wept bitter tears,
and the lions and tigers howled in the desert,
and when the giraffes and ostriches saw that
the garden was empty, they lost their appetites.</p>
<p>One day Selim Pasha met an old man who
was selling bowls and vases of glass at the
palace gate. Because the prince was wrapped
in black and walked unattended, the old man
did not recognize him, and thought he was just
a humble citizen.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp114.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="734" height="347" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good day to you,&rdquo; said the old man.</p>
<p>The prince stopped and bowed, for it pleased
his sorrowful fancy to be taken for an ordinary
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you not like to buy some of my
beautiful vases and bowls?&rdquo; the old man continued.
&ldquo;I have brought them many hundreds
of miles across the desert. Look at them, and
you will not feel so sad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the prince shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not want vases of glass,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;what I seek is magic knowledge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man sat down and set his vases and
bowls in a dazzling row upon the pavement.
They shone in all colors, like the feathers of a
peacock, and reminded the prince of Zarashne&rsquo;s
silken gowns.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am old and wise,&rdquo; said the vendor. &ldquo;I
have more knowledge of magic than any man
on earth&mdash;more even than Bulbo, who lives in
the yellow desert. But if you would have a little&mdash;ever
so little&mdash;of it, you must pay the price I
ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything, anything you desire,&rdquo; cried the
prince, &ldquo;though you ask all the treasures of
Orient Land!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will have none of your treasures. All I
ask is your service. I need an apprentice in my
workshop, many hundreds of miles away across
the desert, and if you will come and blow glass
for me for seven years, you shall have the
secret knowledge for your reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince thought deeply for a moment.
What would his people say if they ever found
out that their ruler had become a glass-maker&rsquo;s
apprentice? But then, was not Princess Zarashne&rsquo;s
return worth any sacrifice?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will go with you and be your apprentice,&rdquo;
said Selim Pasha the Proud, Prince of Orient
Land, &ldquo;but wait until I get a bundle of clothes,
and tell the head-cook not to expect me for
dinner, and ask the Lord Chamberlain to feed
my white mouse and my bird of Paradise until
I come back!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp117.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="607" height="326" />
</div>
<p>That same day they mounted camels and
set out on their long journey across the desert.
They passed the castle of Bulbo, but the rivers
that surrounded it were so wide and the ramparts
of yellow sand so high that Selim Pasha
could not see over them, though he stood on
tip-toe on his camel&rsquo;s hump. Sadly he rode by
and followed the old glass-maker to his city,
many hundreds of miles away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>When they reached the city, the old man led
him to a dingy little house made of bricks and
mud. It was very dark inside, for there were
no windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand very still, my lad, till I light the lamp,
or you will break some precious glass!&rdquo; said
the old man. Then he struck a light, and Selim
Pasha beheld a most wonderful sight. All
about him were vases and bowls and cups of
iridescent glass standing on shelves of crystal,
and there were delicate flowers made of glass
and glittering prisms that caught the lamplight
and threw back a thousand brilliant hues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you shall work for seven years,&rdquo; said
the old man, &ldquo;and I will teach you how to make
all these things, but you will have to sleep on a
mat upon the floor, and eat from the bowl after
I have eaten, because you are an apprentice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do as you say,&rdquo; replied Selim Pasha
the Proud.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>So the Prince of Orient Land made glass
for seven years, and slept on a mat upon the
floor, and ate from the bowl after his master
had eaten. When the seven years were over,
his master said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Selim Pasha, I have taught you all there is
to know about glass-making; now make me a
bowl of rainbow-colored glass, so large that a
man can sit within it; so bright that no one can
see through the glass because of its beautiful
colors; and so light that the littlest breeze may
carry it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when I have made the bowl,&rdquo; said
the prince, &ldquo;shall I then have my reward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you have made the bowl, we will
talk about your reward.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>So Selim Pasha sat up three days and three
nights with the glass-blower&rsquo;s lamps between
his knees, and the glass-blower&rsquo;s rod in his
mouth. Finally he made a bowl so large that he
himself could hide within it, so bright that no
one could see through it because of its beautiful
colors and so light that the littlest breeze
could carry it away. Then he noticed that the
edge of the glass was not smooth, so he dipped
his finger in water and ran it around and around.</p>
<p>Suddenly the bowl began to sing, as glasses
do when you rub around the edge&mdash;and he
could understand quite plainly, what it sang!
The fairies that lived in the rainbow colors
were singing together:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Over the yellow desert sands,</p>
<p class="t0">Prince of all the Orient Lands,</p>
<p class="t0">Come, we will bear thee now!</p>
<p class="t0">O come away in thy crystal ship</p>
<p class="t0">And watch the ancient river slip</p>
<p class="t0">Under thy glassy prow!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>Then he knew that in this glass was the
magic that he had worked for seven years to
learn. Carefully he took the great bowl out of
doors. It was very early in the morning, and
his master was still asleep, so he wrote &ldquo;goodbye&rdquo;
and &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; on the door, and making
no sound, climbed into the bowl that was
blazing with color in the sunlight.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp121.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="554" height="434" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>No sooner was he settled than a little breeze
crept down the street, picked up the beautiful
bubble, and wafted it high into the air! He
floated over the roofs of the town, and he could
smell the breakfasts cooking, which made him
very hungry. Then he passed over the green
meadows that surrounded the town, and could
see cows and oxen below him that looked no
bigger than Noah&rsquo;s-ark animals. At last he
came to the desert and by sunset he had reached
the river that had flowed around Bulbo&rsquo;s castle.
Then he felt the glass bubble sinking, down,
down, down, until it rested like a ship on the
river, and he saw the dim green waters gliding
under him.</p>
<p>Finally the great bowl drifted ashore.
Princess Zarashne was near the river gathering
pearls and shells, and when she saw the beautiful
crystal sphere, she ran swiftly and called
to Bulbo:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Bulbo, Bulbo, come and see what the
river has brought to you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>Bulbo came, and looked in amazement at
the huge bowl. Fortunately he was a little man
and doubled up with age so that he could not
see over the edge of the bowl, and of course he
could not see through it, because of its beautiful
colors. Only Princess Zarashne could look over
the edge, and when she saw who was inside,
she could not suppress a little scream, though
Selim Pasha had made her a sign to be quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Bulbo, when he heard
her scream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a spider,&rdquo; she replied quickly.</p>
<p>Bulbo called six of his black sprites to take
the bowl on their shoulders and carry it to his
flower garden. When they had set it down
among the roses and pansies and dreamy lotos-flowers,
Bulbo went indoors for his supper, but
Zarashne stayed outside and looked into the
glimmering depths of the bowl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;O Zarashne, beautiful Zarashne,&rdquo; whispered
Selim Pasha, &ldquo;I have come to set you free!&rdquo;
And all the evening they whispered together,
while the garden went to sleep and the moon
rose and the nightingales began to sing. Then
Bulbo came to the window with a candle, and
called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zarashne! It is time for you to go to bed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Zarashne did not heed him, and at last
he came out into the garden.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp124.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="662" height="521" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you lean over that bowl and look
into it all the time, Zarashne? I have called
you seven times and you have not answered
me!&rdquo; he said in great anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see the reflection of my face,&rdquo; replied
Princess Zarashne, and continued to gaze down
and whisper to Selim Pasha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do not come into the house,&rdquo; cried
Bulbo, &ldquo;I will break the bowl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Zarashne was frightened and would
have followed him, but she could not tear herself
from her lover, who was saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodnight, goodnight, most beautiful flower
of Allah&rsquo;s garden! Goodnight, my princess!&rdquo;
So she lingered just another moment and then
another, till Bulbo was too angry to call her any
more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are a vain, vain woman,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;to gaze so long at your own image, and I will
put an end to it.&rdquo; He tore a big branch from
the nearest pomegranate tree, and before she
could prevent it, he struck the beautiful bowl
with all his might. It flew into a thousand
glittering fragments; but in the midst of it stood
Selim Pasha the Proud, Prince of Orient Land,
his sword bared and shining in the moonlight.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp126.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="754" height="422" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;Treason,&rdquo; screamed the little sorcerer,
&ldquo;treason!&rdquo; and fell on his knees before the Prince.
Then Bulbo&rsquo;s servants, his bats and sprites, came
running to help him. But when Bulbo had
broken the crystal bowl, the rainbow fairies who
had been imprisoned in the glass, were all set
free, and they took splinters of the glass for
swords, and fought a dreadful battle with Bulbo&rsquo;s
sprites, among the poppies and nightshade and
the lovely poison berry-bushes. At last the
rainbow fairies were victorious, and Selim Pasha
sheathed his terrible sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not kill you, Bulbo, because you are
small and old,&rdquo; said the magnanimous prince.
&ldquo;But you shall be banished.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>Then the prince gathered up the fragments of
his bowl, which looked like common window
glass now, for the rainbow fairies had taken all
of the beautiful colors with them, and taking
his glass-blower&rsquo;s lamp, he blew the pieces into
a perfect sphere all around old Bulbo. Then he
drew a great breath&mdash;poof! and the globe rose
into the air, higher and higher among the clouds,
till the winds wafted it thousands of miles away.
People who saw it and the little man inside,
thought it was the moon. Where it came down
was never known, but old Bulbo had vanished
forever from Orient Land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now we are in Bulbo&rsquo;s palace,&rdquo; said
Princess Zarashne, &ldquo;and your crystal ship is
gone; how shall we get across the river?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have no fear,&rdquo; replied the prince, &ldquo;the
fairies will help us.&rdquo; Then he called them all
together, and they went down to the yellow
sands, where they spread their shining wings
and made a rainbow bridge over which Selim
Pasha the Proud led his princess back to Orient
Land.</p>

<p>His people were overjoyed to see him again,
for they had long thought him dead. His soldiers
had forgotten how to march, for they had
been idle so long, and when they tried to
blow the trumpets, they found them all rusty
and useless. The Lord Chamberlain was discovered
hiding under the throne, for he had
forgotten to feed the white mouse and the bird
of Paradise, who would have starved if the
head-cook had not taken pity on them every
day. But Selim Pasha pretended not to notice
anything that was wrong; he invited everybody
to his marriage-feast, for the lovely Princess
Zarashne became his queen, and they spread
a banquet-table three miles long so even the
humblest beggar could partake. There was
another table, too, for the animals who had not
eaten with a real appetite for seven years, and
were awfully hungry now. And at this great
banquet Selim Pasha told the story of his adventures.
Some believed his tale and others
did not, but they all rejoiced to have him back,
and he and Queen Zarashne lived together in
peace and happiness and ruled their people
wisely for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>Far, far away, on a strange northern shore
by the White Sea, there was once a rich and
royal city. The streets were paved with silver,
the walls were shining marble, and the church
steeples were topped with gold so they
gleamed at night in the starlight like big
bright moons. The city belonged to a strong
and splendid monarch whom people called
The Merciless Tsar. He lived in a palace of
black marble and ivory with terraces of turquoise
mosaic, windows of pure crystal and
heavy curtains of silver cloth brocaded with
brilliant designs. The Tsar had no pity for
the poor and humble; he wrapped himself in
a mantle of pride, and made subject kings
and princes wait on him at table, and help
him into his coat when he went out to
drive in his golden chariot behind twelve
black horses. If a poor beggar was bold and
foolish enough to cry out to him: &ldquo;Alms, alms,
for the love of St. Peter, O most wealthy and
wonderful!&rdquo; he would order the driver to
crack his whip over the beggar&rsquo;s stooping
shoulders and drive the unhappy wretch before
his chariot for miles and miles. When
people cheered him as he passed, he pretended
not to hear because he thought he was
too great to listen to them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>One day in winter he was driving by the
frozen shore of the White Sea, when he saw
a ragged young lad fishing through a big hole
in the ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that hideous rag-bag catching fish
through the ice?&rdquo; he asked his chancellor who
sat on the front seat beside the driver.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp135.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="468" height="317" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;O most wealthy and wonderful, it is the
humblest of your citizens, Hanka the Fool,&rdquo;
replied the chancellor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him by the collar,&rdquo; ordered the
Merciless Tsar, &ldquo;and plunge him through his
hole in the ice. I want to see his face when
he comes up again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the chancellor commanded one coachman
to descend and dip poor Hanka into the
freezing water, and of course the coachman
had to obey or else have his head cut off.
He grabbed The Fool by his collar and gave
him a kick from behind, and Hanka fell
screaming through his hole in the thick white
ice. The Tsar declared he had never seen
anything so funny in all his life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do it again,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;do it again!&rdquo;
Poor Hanka the Fool was nearly frozen to
death before the Tsar grew tired of him and
let him go. He had a cold for weeks after,
and if his mother had not given him hot tea
and put him to bed with warm flat-irons at
his feet as soon as he got home, he probably
would have died.</p>

<p>A few days later, while the Tsar was sitting
in state upon his throne, feeling bored
and cross and merciless, a stranger came to
the city from the distant North, driving over
the frozen sea. He drove all alone in a sleigh
with three white horses whose trappings were
hung with icicles that tinkled like bells. His
hair was long and flaxen, his blue eyes were
clear as stars, and he wore a flowing white
cape that looked like feathery, newly fallen
snow. Of course everyone thought he would
stop at the inn near the city gate, but he
drove up the highway through all the town,
and did not stop till he came to the palace of
the Tsar. Then he reined in his horses, stood
up in his sleigh and called with all his might.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Brother Tsar! Give me a lodging for
the night, for I am weary of wayfaring. Give
me a bed and a place at thy board, and fodder
for my horses, that we may rest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tsar thought the stranger must be a
madman, and sent out a slave to drive him
away. But the wayfarer would not go.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Tsar!&rdquo; he cried again, &ldquo;Brother
Tsar!&rdquo; Then the Tsar jumped up from his
throne in a rage, snatched a whip from one of
his coachmen, and stepped out, in all his
pride and glory, upon the terraces of turquoise
mosaic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Away!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;Away, or I will have
thee bound and tortured!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, thou wilt not grant me even a
night&rsquo;s lodging under thy roof?&rdquo; exclaimed
the wayfarer.</p>
<p>The Tsar cracked his whip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begone, thou mad intruder!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp138.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="800" height="139" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will be gone,&rdquo; returned the stranger,
seizing the reins and jerking up his horses in
great anger. &ldquo;But henceforth there shall be
war between thee and me. I will sack thy
city and send thee begging, O merciless Tsar,
for the affront thou hast offered me today.
Know that I am the Strength of the Storm and
Ruler of the Great Ice, King Winter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tsar turned pale when he heard these
words, but before he could make any excuses,
the chariot with the three white horses and
the tinkling icicles had turned about and was
flying far, far away to Northward, over the
boundless stretches of the Great Ice. So the
Merciless Tsar went back into the throne-chamber
and said to his chancellor, &ldquo;Bah!
How could King Winter sack my city, anyway?
I&rsquo;d like to see him try!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>That very day it began to snow so hard
that the children all through the city could
not go to school. The boys went out and
shovelled the silver pavements, but soon they
had thrown so much snow into the middles
of the streets that even the strongest sleigh
could not get through any more, and the
streets looked like thick, white walls between
the side walks. And still it snowed and
snowed and snowed. Soon the piles in the
street became so high that the boys and even
the men could not throw any more snow on
top. Then the sidewalks were all snowed up,
and the steps of the houses were covered, and
the snow rose in walls against the first-story
windows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp141.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="800" height="503" />
</div>
<p>Round the palace the piles were so great
that the turquoise terraces could no longer be
shovelled, and they snowed up just like the
streets. The Tsar grew very angry when he
saw the white walls rising outside his windows,
making his rooms all dark and chilly. He sent
out his entire household to shovel and sweep;
from the cook to the Lord High Chancellor,
even the ladies in waiting had to go out with
brooms. There were not enough snow shovels,
but he made them use coal shovels and dust-pans,
and the youngest kitchen-boy kept the
window-sills cleared with the pancake turner.
But still the snow came down and down, till
there was no place to shovel it to, because it
was everywhere. It rose to the second stories
and blocked all the windows of all the houses.
People in the town lived in the garrets, and
even the Tsar, fuming with anger, had to move
into one of the high towers of his palace. All
the stables and barns were snowed up and
people had to let the horses live with them in their
sitting rooms and put the sleighs into the halls
and spare-rooms. But the snow fell faster and
faster till it was level with the roofs and threatened
to block even the dormer windows. Then
they knew that there was only one thing they
could do; they had to leave the city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>The Tsar ordered everybody to pack up as
many things as the sleighs could carry, food and
clothes and cook-pots and the children&rsquo;s school-books,
money and jewels, tool-chests and linen-chests,
cups and saucers, bed-clothes and
brushes and tooth-powder, and flee from the
city before the snow should bury them all alive.
He himself headed the procession with ten
golden sleighs, each drawn by twelve black
horses. Thus the whole population of the rich
and royal city climbed out of dormer windows
or broken roofs, and drove through the
snowstorm toward the South, where the great
dark forests were. When they looked back for
the last time, the snow had already covered the
roofs, till only the golden tops of the
church-steeples showed above it, and a few
hours later even these disappeared. King Winter
had sacked the city of the Merciless Tsar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>Three days and nights the Tsar and his
people had to drive, before they came to a place
where the snow was light enough so they could
shovel it and really reach the solid brown earth
underneath. That was in the great forests,
where owls hooted, wolves howled, and foxes
barked all night, and big bears sat up on their
haunches to watch the newcomers with doubt
and curiosity. The people took saws and axes,
hammers and nails out of their tool-chest and
began to cut down big trees and build rude log-cabins
to live in.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp143.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="368" height="230" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Build mine first,&rdquo; said the Tsar, sitting in
his sleigh and jiggling his feet to keep warm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>So they all labored together and made him
a wooden palace, with stables for his horses and
quarters for the coachmen and a big wooden
terrace for his Majesty to walk on after dinner.
Then they made their own houses close around,
and a wall of brushwood, thorns and vines
about the whole settlement, to keep the wolves
and bears away.</p>
<p>Thus they lived for months and months in
great misery. Soon all their food was eaten up,
and the men had to go hunting, but they could
not kill enough game to feed such a large population.
Then the Tsar became quite terrified,
for he knew that he must starve very soon if
they found no help. Several times he sent
messengers to the distant shore of the White
Sea, to find out whether the snow had not
melted and his city reappeared; but everyone
who came back said no, the city was not to be
found; you could not even tell where it had
been.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic6">
<img src="images/pp144fp.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="625" />
<p class="caption">At last ... he saw a tiny square of window light behind some thick holly bushes</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, will no one tell me how I may recover
my city?&rdquo; cried the Tsar in despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the Wise Woman in the forest
could tell you,&rdquo; replied the Lord Chancellor.
&ldquo;She is King Winter&rsquo;s mother&mdash;in fact they say
she is the mother of all the kings in the world.
And she is said to know everything. But it is
hard to find her. You must come to her hut
all alone, some cold night under the Northern
Lights, and knock three times upon her door,
calling, &lsquo;Mother Mir! Mother Mir!&rsquo; Then perhaps
she will answer you&mdash;and perhaps she
won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>So the Tsar waited for a cold, bright night,
when the Northern Lights played across the
starlit sky, and on that night he went out all
alone into the deep forest. He wrapped himself
in his richest purple cape, set his crown
upon his head and put white ermine boots on
his feet. As he walked unattended over the
frosted snow, under the great pine branches,
he looked so royal that the wolves in the forest
stood at a respectful distance and did not dare
to eat him, though he was all alone. He walked
for an hour or more and wondered whether he
had gone in the wrong direction to find the Wise
Woman&rsquo;s hut. At last, just when he was
ready to give up the search, he saw a tiny
square of window-light behind some thick
holly-bushes, and following that, he came upon
the hut.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>It was low and covered with heavy moss,
patched with snow and edged with black pine
cones. The little window pane was a sheet of
ice. (In summer it melted away, but then the
Wise Woman would not need a window pane,
for the air coming in would not be cold.) The
door was made of rough bark and had a big,
twisted root tied to it for a knocker. The Tsar
picked up the root and let it fall three times:
Thump! Thump! Thump!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother Mir!&rdquo; he called, and his voice
sounded very big in the still, black forest,
&ldquo;Mother Mir! Mother Mir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first he thought she was not going to
open, but by and by the door swung back, all
by itself, and he stooped and went into the
little room. There was a fire on the hearth;
near it on a pile of leaves sat the brown old
woman, counting lily-seeds. She had hands
like gnarled wood, and long grey hair that
swept the floor. But her eyes were keen and
clear and her lips were red.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;A million and three, a million and four,&rdquo;
she counted, dropping the seeds into a bag.
&ldquo;A million and five, and six, and seven, and
eight; a million and nine red lily seeds.&rdquo; Then
she tied up one bag, pushed it into a corner,
and opened another with seeds of a different
kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening to you, Mother Mir,&rdquo; said
the Tsar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Tsar; have thy people sent
thee to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sent me!&rdquo; he cried, drawing himself up so
he bumped his crown on the ceiling. &ldquo;Sent
me, indeed! I am the most wealthy and wonderful
Tsar and no one could keep me or send
me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp148.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="743" height="414" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;Except King Winter,&rdquo; the Wise Woman
corrected him.</p>
<p>The Tsar flushed with anger and pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I came to thee, Mother Mir.
What shall I do to recover my buried city?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What thou must do, is very simple, O
merciless Tsar. But if thou art not willing to
do it thou shalt never see thy city again. Thou
must repent of thy mercilessness, and become
as humble as Hanka the Fool. Thou must give
all thy wealth away; and let thy last gift be to
a poor wayfarer, to atone for thy sin, that thou
didst refuse a wayfarer shelter and food in thy
palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tsar was puzzled. He had never
thought how wicked he was and did not know
what it would be like to repent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How shall I repent, Mother Mir?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go back to thy people, look into their
houses, see how hungry and unhappy they are
because of thy mercilessness; perhaps it will
make thee repent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how shall I recover my city by being
humble, O most Wise Woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have told thee all thou needst to know;
now go thy way and let me count my seeds, for
Spring will come and I must plant these flowers
throughout all the forests of the world and they
all are numbered, though people think they
grow wild by themselves.&rdquo; Then she began
counting seeds in the new bag: &ldquo;One, two,
three, four, five&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tsar went home through the wintry
forest, under the Northern Lights, still wondering
what it would feel like to repent. When he
returned to his people he did as the Wise
Woman had told him&mdash;stopped at one house
after another, and looked in at the windows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp151.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="634" height="407" />
</div>
<p>In the first house he saw a mother who was
so ill that she had to lie in bed while the father
cooked the dinner and the dog was trying to
mind the babies; and the dinner for them all
was one woody turnip. The babies were crying,
the mother was crying, the dog was crying,
and the father said over his cooking-pot:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all the fault of the Merciless Tsar. If
he had not been so proud and haughty and
turned that strange wayfarer from his door, we
would not be starving now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>The Tsar, watching through the window, felt
a shiver run down his spine. &ldquo;I might send
them a little of my wealth,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;just to
stop their crying.&rdquo; Then he turned away and
looked in at the next hut.</p>
<p>Here he saw an old man on his knees praying
to St. Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O dear St. Peter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;please take me
to heaven soon, for I have such awful back-aches
that I don&rsquo;t want to live any more. I got
them from being whipped when I begged the
Merciless Tsar for a penny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tsar felt his conscience twinge him a
little. &ldquo;I will send him a doctor to rub his
back,&rdquo; he said. And he turned away again and
went to the third house.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp152.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="480" height="414" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>Here sat a young girl, all alone, spinning
thin cotton thread with frozen fingers. All the
time as she spun, the tears were running down
her face. The Tsar took off his crown, turned
his cloak inside out so one could not see the
rich purple velvet, but only the lining, left his
boots outside, and went into the hut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a stranger,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let me sit
down a moment and get warm. And tell me
why thou art crying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because my lover is dead,&rdquo; replied the girl,
setting a chair for the stranger. &ldquo;He had his
head cut off for contradicting the Tsar. And
now even if we should return to our city, even
if I should be rich and care-free, I can never,
never be happy again.&rdquo; And she cried harder
than ever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now what could I do to help her?&rdquo; thought
the Tsar. But suddenly it occurred to him that
there was nothing in the world he could do that
would bring her lover back or even make her
any happier again. Then he felt so sorry that
the tears ran down his cheeks, too, and he went
outside and threw himself down upon the snow
for unhappiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I have been so wicked!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I
have been so merciless that I have made all my
people miserable. And I can&rsquo;t help the poor
girl, and it&rsquo;s all my fault&mdash;I have been so
awfully, awfully wicked!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All night long, he lay in the snow, even
after all the window-lights had gone out, and
no one knew he was there. When morning
came and people opened their doors to see
what the weather was like, they saw their most
wealthy and wonderful Tsar, without boots or
crown and with his coat turned inside out, lying
face down, on the ground. They called the
Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chamberlain
and many other lords from the wooden palace,
and ran to pick him up, for they thought he
must be dead or at least fainted. But when
they touched him he sat up all by himself and
looked at their surprised faces.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your wonderful highness, what has happened?&rdquo;
they cried.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp155.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="639" height="351" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have repented!&rdquo; replied the Tsar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp156.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="718" height="386" />
</div>
<p>Henceforth he became so humble and mild
that people called him the Merciful Tsar. He
took a basket of food and carried it to the poor
people who had only one woody turnip to eat,
and he went to the lame old man with a bottle
of liniment and rubbed his back till it got
well, and every day he sent some gift, a jewel
or a gold-piece or a silver thimble, or something
of the sort, to comfort the girl whose lover had
been beheaded for contradicting him. He gave
his wooden palace to his lords and ladies, and
moved into a tiny brown hut, moss-covered
and patched and without window-panes, way at
the end of the village. No beggar ever went
empty-handed from his door; and if a little boy
cut his finger or bumped his knee, the other
boys would say:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go to the Tsar, Aliushka, he will put a rag
with ointment on it and make it well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon he had given away so much of his
wealth that he was quite the poorest man in the
village. One day just as he sat down to eat his
last piece of dry bread, a very weary old woman
came to his door and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alms, alms, for the love of St. Peter, O
most Merciful Tsar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing but this piece of bread, but
you may have it,&rdquo; he replied, and gave her his
frugal dinner. The old woman sank down upon
the block of wood that was his only chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but you don&rsquo;t know how weary I am!&rdquo;
she sighed, nibbling the bread with her toothless
gums. &ldquo;I have no hut to live in, no place to
lay my head, no roof to shelter me from the
icy winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art sleepy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Lie down on
the bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as she had lain down and fallen
asleep, he took a piece of charcoal from the
fire place and wrote on the table, where she
would surely see it when she woke up:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take my hut, and my bed, and everything
I own. I have moved out. There is another
piece of bread in the kitchen drawer, but it is
mouldy.&rdquo; Then he left the hut, shut the door
carefully so the snow should not blow in and
went to the village gate, where there was a
public bench; there he sat down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>Presently he heard a great commotion in the
village; a lot of people were coming toward the
gate where he sat. In their midst walked
Hanka, the Fool, with big boots on his feet, an
axe in his belt, and a fishing-rod over his shoulder.
Everybody was shouting to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck on thy way! Good luck,
Hanka! Good luck to thee, brave wayfarer,
may all the Saints help thee against the wolves
in the forest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where art thou going, Hanka?&rdquo; asked the
Tsar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Far away to the White Sea,&rdquo; replied the
Fool. &ldquo;We are all starving in the village, so I
am going to chop a hole through the ice and
catch fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; replied the Tsar, suddenly remembering
what the Wise Mother Mir had told him.
&ldquo;Thou art a wayfarer now, Hanka, and I
should give thee my last gift to atone for my old
cruelty to the wayfarer who came to my palace-gate.
But I have nothing, nothing left to give,
not even a safety-pin!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;Give me thy blessing, O most Merciful
Tsar,&rdquo; said Hanka the Fool. &ldquo;Surely with a
Tsar&rsquo;s blessing I could go safely in my long and
arduous way. It would keep off the wolves and
bears and robbers that attack poor wayfarers in
the forest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp160.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="363" height="222" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will give thee my blessing,&rdquo; agreed
the Tsar.</p>
<p>So Hanka knelt down in the snow, and the
Tsar gave him a blessing for the journey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>Hanka travelled for many days through deep
and drifted snow. Over his head the black
crows flew from tree to tree, and all night when
he crouched by his brushwood fire he heard
the wolves howling and the foxes barking in the
great forest. But no beast or bird or prowling
robber ever tried to hurt him; that was because
he traveled with the Tsar&rsquo;s blessing on his head.</p>
<p>At last he came to a great field of ice and
snow that he supposed was the White Sea. He
took his axe and began to chop the frozen floor,
because he was a fool and did not know that
there was really solid land under his feet.
Suddenly his axe struck on something that
cracked like wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; cried Hanka, jumping back
and dropping his axe. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be ice, for it
isn&rsquo;t clear; it isn&rsquo;t wood, for it&rsquo;s too white; it
isn&rsquo;t stone, for it&rsquo;s too brittle; I know!&rdquo; and he
jumped up and down with pleasure because
he knew. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ivory!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>It really was ivory. Hanka was standing
on the buried city, and his axe had broken the
ivory roof of the Tsar&rsquo;s palace!</p>
<p>He went on chopping, and digging the snow
and splinters away with his hands. At last
there was such a big hole that he could jump
into it. There was a deep, dark chamber underneath,
but Hanka was not afraid, so he let
himself down through the hole.</p>
<p>Here he stood, in the empty, snowed-up
palace of the Tsar! Of course he had never
been in it before, and though it was dark and
damp, and had not been cleaned for a year, he
thought it was almost too splendid to be real.
He took a match from his pocket, struck it on
the wall and looked round by its feeble flare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;Golden chairs,&rdquo; he whispered, so much impressed
that he could not speak aloud, &ldquo;and velvet
rugs and such bright, brocaded curtains! I
have heard people talk about these things, but
I have never believed they were real. Here is
a door, and a stairway; that must lead downstairs.
Oh, I will go all through the palace and
look and look!&rdquo; He went softly down the
stairs, striking matches to light his way, and
putting the burnt ends into his pocket so as not
to litter the floors.</p>
<p>The whole palace was just as the Tsar and his
people had left it in their flight. From some
of the rooms they had carried off the bed-clothes
and things, but in others the beds were unmade
and odd stockings and handkerchiefs and powder-puffs
lay around, that no one had thought
to take along. Hanka picked them all up and
put them neatly on a chair. Here he found a
candle, too, so he could light his way without
striking matches all the time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>He went to the kitchen and found it very
untidy, for the cook had left in a hurry. He
had left the cake in the oven, where it had
burned to ashes and some milk on the window
sill, where it had turned to cheese and then to
something worse, so Hanka held his nose with
one hand while he washed the pitcher with the
other. But in a beautiful box he discovered
some crackers that were still quite good, and
on a shelf above it was a pot of jam, so he sat
down on the table-corner and ate to his heart&rsquo;s
content, for he was nearly starved.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp164.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="493" height="403" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>When he could eat no more, he remembered
how often he had heard people talk about the
marvels of the great throne-chamber, where the
musicians used to play and the Lord Chancellor
to read in a loud voice all the news from the
Tsar&rsquo;s empire, and where people were brought
trembling before the throne to be sentenced to
death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must see the chamber,&rdquo; thought Hanka.
So he prowled through all the pantries and
banquet halls and reception rooms till he came
to a door of ebony and gold, richly inlaid with
mother-of-pearl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This must be it,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;If I
only dared to look in! Of course, it will be
quite empty&mdash;the musicians have left it and the
Lord Chancellor is not there and the throne is
deserted&mdash;but still it must be very splendid.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>Carefully he shot back the silver bolt and
the great door swung open. A breath of very
cold air struck his face, as though he had
stepped into an ice-cave. And for a moment
he really thought he had. In the four corners
of the room stood four great men of ice, with
folded hands, heads bowed under the ceiling,
and eyes that shone like cold December stars.
They were the four Spirits of the North: Silence,
and Frost, and Loneliness, and Northern Light,
who guarded the city since the Tsar and his
people had fled. And on the Throne in the
middle of the room sat King Winter with a
crown of ice upon his head and a foot-stool of
snow under his feet.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>Hanka&rsquo;s knees shook with terror and he
dropped his candle on the mosaic floor. The
candle went out, yet the room was full of light,
a still, blue light, like the reflections in a block
of ice. The four great men did not move. But
King Winter raised his hand and beckoned to
the lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; he said quite kindly. Hanka
had fallen to his knees, and crept upon them
across the floor, holding up his hands for mercy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo; demanded the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have pity, O most wonderful King! I am
only Hanka the Fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have ye come back from the great forests,
thou and thy friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied Hanka, kissing his feet, &ldquo;It is
only I who have come. I did not mean to chop
through the roof of the palace. I meant to chop
a hole in the ice of the White Sea to catch some
fish, for the Tsar and his people are starving.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thou hast come alone?&rdquo; asked King Winter
in surprise, &ldquo;How is it that wolves and bears
and all the wild beasts have spared thee, and
robbers have not beaten thee to death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, O Most Wonderful Majesty, I
traveled with the Tsar&rsquo;s blessing on my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>King Winter sat up, and even the four
Spirits looked startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But since when,&rdquo; asked the King, &ldquo;doth the
proud Merciless Tsar stoop to give his blessing
to such a beggar-lad as thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Hanka, &ldquo;he is not proud, indeed
he isn&rsquo;t! He is as humble as I am, even I,
Hanka the Fool. We call him the Merciful Tsar,
for he has turned from all his wickedness, and
given his wealth away. I was a wayfarer, and
he had no other gift for me, so he gave me his
blessing, Most Wonderful King!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>At these words King Winter arose, the four
spirits lifted their heads, there was a murmur of
many voices and then fairy music everywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rise up, Hanka,&rdquo; said the Ruler of the North.
&ldquo;My reign in the City is over, for the Merciless
Tsar has repented and become as humble as
thou. Go back to the great forests where thy
Tsar and his people are, and tell them to return
hither, for King Winter and his forces have left
the city, and it belongs to the Tsar once more!
In token of this, in case thou shouldst forget
what to say, take that bag of snow-stars behind
the Throne, and carry it to the Tsar.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp169.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="295" height="270" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>While he spoke, a whole army of spirits, snow-fairies
and wind-fairies and genie, crowned with
frost-flowers, gathered from all parts of the palace.
Some came from the bedrooms, where they had
been asleep in the bureau-drawers, some from
the kitchen where they had been hiding under
cups and mixing-bowls, some peeped down over
the pictures on the parlor wall, or between the
curtains, or even out of the empty hall-stove.
They all joined hands in a ring and danced around
Hanka, who sat bewildered on the floor with his
axe and fishing-rod, wondering where all these
creatures had been while he had explored the
palace.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp170.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="800" height="139" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Joy, joy,&rdquo; sang the spirits, &ldquo;we are going
home again, home to the North Pole, to our
friends, the seals and polar bears, the long waiting-time
is over, for the Merciless Tsar has repented&mdash;joy,
joy, joy!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>Then there was a tinkle of icicles outside the
door, as King Winter&rsquo;s sleigh with the three white
horses came jingling up. The palace doors flew
open and Hanka saw that the snow had already
melted down almost to the turquoise terraces.
The king leaped into his chariot, waved his
hand to the humble fool who had followed him
to the door, and away went the royal horses,
over the frozen White Sea to the distant North
Pole, with all the fairy train holding on and running
behind as swiftly as the wind.</p>
<p>Hanka turned back and looked at the empty
throne chamber. The four great Spirits had
vanished, though he had not seen them running
away with the fairies. But where they had stood,
the floor was cracked a little, and four yellow
crocus-flowers had sprung up through the stone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>Hanka felt very lonesome and frightened in
the big, splendid palace. He picked up his axe
and rod and the bag of snow-stars King Winter
had ordered him to take, and ran as fast as he
could through the open door, over the terraces,
through the town and gates to the open country
outside. Everywhere the snow had gone away
so quickly that the second stories of all the houses
were quite free and the first stories just appearing.
Beyond the gates, he came upon great
streams of water that were running down to the
White Sea, where the ice was melting and wiping
out the track of King Winter&rsquo;s sleigh. Hanka
turned toward the South, to the great forests
where the Tsar&rsquo;s people had built their wooden
village. He sang aloud as he walked, because
the warm sun was shining on his back, and his
stomach was full of crackers and jam, so he felt
very happy despite the heavy bag of snow-stars
on his shoulder. If he had not been a fool he
would certainly have wondered why they were
so heavy; but he was a fool so he just carried
them and did not wonder at anything. Above
him in the treetops the birds were singing as
happily as he, the air smelled sweet and warm,
and in some places Mother Mir&rsquo;s flowers were
peeping through the thin, wet snow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I believe it&rsquo;s going to be Spring!&rdquo; said
Hanka.</p>
<p>In the village, the Tsar was still sitting on the
bench beside the gate. The villagers came to
offer him food, but he refused it, saying &ldquo;You
have not enough for yourselves. I will not eat
your food. Give it to your children, good
people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will starve!&rdquo; they cried. &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo;
replied the Tsar. &ldquo;Some good Saint will take
care of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in the night, when the village was quiet
and dark, the crows in the forest flew to him
and brought him some frozen berries, the squirrels
brought nuts to appease his hunger, and the
fairies from the great Forest brought partridge-eggs
and reindeer milk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pp174.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="337" height="263" />
</div>
<p>It was a beautiful sunny morning, when the
villagers who stood about the gate talking to the
Tsar saw Hanka returning, with his axe and rod
and a bag over his shoulder. &ldquo;Look, look,&rdquo;
they cried, &ldquo;he is bringing a whole bagful of
fish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where do you suppose he got the bag?&rdquo;
said the Tsar. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t have it when he
left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were not kept guessing very long.
Hanka came running and shouting:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;Greetings, O Merciful Tsar, greetings from
King Winter! He gave me a message to thee,
but I have forgotten it, but here is a bag of snow-stars
for thee, and thy city is all thawed out,
King Winter has gone back to the North Pole.
And I went through thy palace and found lots of
crackers and jam, which I ate. I didn&rsquo;t mean
to steal, but there was nobody to ask for them
so I had to take them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tsar smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art welcome to my crackers and jam,
dear Hanka,&rdquo; he said, as he opened the bag of
snow-stars, took it by the lower corners, and
turned it upside down.</p>
<p>Out of the bag rolled thousands and thousands
of sparkling, flashing diamonds! The
people stood open-mouthed, and Hanka sat
down with surprise when he saw what he had
been carrying.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;That means we may return, for King Winter&rsquo;s
war is over,&rdquo; said the Tsar. So all the people
went back to their city on the shores of the White
Sea, where the streets were paved with silver,
the walls were shining marble, and the church
steeples were topped with gold. The Tsar sat
on his throne again, but he ruled his people
now with mercy and justice, so everyone liked
to be brought before him to see his mild fatherly
face.</p>
<p>Hanka was allowed to live in the palace all
his life, and had a silver fishing-rod, a silken line
and a diamond sinker, and was permitted to cast
for gold-fish in the royal pond. King Winter
came for a visit once every year with a little
snow just to remind people of his past reign;
but he always found the people ready to joke
and laugh at the bad weather he brought, for
they were all happy and contented who lived in
the city of the Merciful Tsar.</p>
